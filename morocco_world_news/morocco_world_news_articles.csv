0,"Mexican Delegation To Visit Morocco, Keen To Consolidate Relations","Migration management, the fight against climate change, and the Western Sahara dispute are expected to be the main subjects of bilateral discussions.",Souad Anouar,"June 08, 2022 4:20 p.m.","Rabat - A Mexican parliamentary delegation is expected to pay a working visit to Morocco on Friday, June 10, to consolidate bilateral relations in the management of migration flows and climate change as well as address questions of shared interest. 
Olga Sanchez Cordero, Board of Directors of the Mexican Senate, announced the news in her latest meeting with the Moroccan Ambassador to Mexico, Abdellatif Lebbar. 
Cordero is set to meet with Naama Mayara, President of the Moroccan Chamber of Councillors, to discuss prospects of reinforcing coordination and consultation between the countries’ parliaments and public institutions. 
Accompanying Cordero will be Hector Vasconcelos, the President of the Mexican Senate’s Exterior Relations Commission, and Cora Cecilia Pinedo Alonso, President of the Exterior Relations Commission for Asia, Pacific, and Africa. 
Over the past two years, Morocco and Mexico have expressed shared interest in strengthening south-south cooperation at the diplomatic, economic, and cultural levels despite the Mexican recognition and support of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). 
The Mexican rapprochement with SADR was officialized in 1979 with the recognition of former Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda y Alvarez de la Rosa of the separatist entity as a state.  
While the statement reporting Cordero’s visit does not mention Western Sahara, there is potential that the disputed region will be at the center of the upcoming meeting.

Mexican officials and the Mexico-Morocco Friendship Group have repeatedly called for better trade and diplomatic relations to best represent the 60 years of diplomatic ties connecting Rabat and Mexico City. 
These relations will be celebrated by the Moroccan Embassy in Mexico during a one-week event that will provide a wide selection of artistic cultural events and economic forums from July 23 and 31. 
Beyond the celebrations, the Mexico-Morocco Friendship Group has urged Mexican and Latin American governments to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the ""one and only"" solution to the Western Sahara dispute. 
The group has been vocally pro-Moroccan on numerous occasions with regard to developments in Western Sahara, such as the intervention of the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces in the El Guergarat zone to restore civil and commercial traffic between the region and Mauritania. 
Currently, the Mexico-Morocco Friendship Group’s call for the official recognition of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara remains unanswered. In Rabat, however, there is discernible hope that the international wave in support of the Moroccan stance on Western Sahara and the latest rapprochement between the two countries might influence decision-makers in the South American country.

1,Spanish PM Renews Support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan Amid Hostile Campaign,A number of marginal opposition political parties in Spain are taking issue with the Sanchez government’s endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 08, 2022 2:02 p.m.","Rabat - Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has once again renewed his country’s support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.
Appearing at a Congress meeting today, Sanchez insisted that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the “most serious, credible, and realistic basis” to resolve the dispute over Western Sahara.
“We need a consensus exit,” the Spanish PM added, emphasizing that his country continues to support the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable and agreed upon solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara.
Sanchez’s remarks come in response to the hostile campaign a number of marginal opposition parties have launched to put pressure on the government following Spain’s official endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
In addition to the campaign from some MPs supporting Polisario’s claims, Algeria and the separatist group of the Polisario Front continue to release strongly-worded statements in an attempt to convince Spain to reverse its support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal.
In March, Algeria’s government recalled its ambassador to Madrid in protest of Spain’s support for the Moroccan initiative for Western Sahara.
In a telling statement following Spain’s decision in favor of the Moroccan plan, the Algerian government said that it was “surprised” and “astonished,” and it notably threatened to review its gas deal with Spain.

Spain, however, responded to such protests by emphasizing that although it shared good diplomatic relations with Algeria, the North African country had no rights to question, or interfere with Madrid’s “sovereign decision” to support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. 
In April, Spanish FM Jose Manuel Albares emphasized his government’s support of the Moroccan stance on the Sahara question, saying that Madrid had “nothing to add” to its embrace of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
Albares’ remarks angered Algerian officials who described his comments as “derogatory, offensive, and unacceptable.”
Such statements will “certainly not contribute to a rapid return to normal in bilateral relations,” said Amar Belani, whom Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune recently appointed as Algeria’s “special envoy in charge of Western Sahara.”
Spain, however, has repeatedly expressed its determination to preserve its strategic partnership with Morocco.
The latest statement of unwavering support came from Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska who on Tuesday called Morocco a “reliable and fraternal country,” adding: “Our relations with Morocco are extremely loyal.”

2,Moroccan Ambassador: Polisario’s Sultana Khaya is Not a Human Rights Defender,"While presenting herself as a pacifist champion of human rights, Sultana Khaya has been recorded and photographed while holding rifles and calling for war against Morocco.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 08, 2022 11:10 a.m.","Rabat - The Permanent Representative of Morocco to the UN, Omar Hilale, has accused Algeria of hiring Polisario members such as Sultana Khaya to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity.
Hilale addressed a series of letters to the Security Council to expose how Khaya’s maneuvers serve the agenda of the Polisario Front and their biggest supporter, Algeria.
“Sultana Khaya is in no way a defender of human rights, but indeed an agent working for Algeria and the Polisario,” said the Moroccan ambassador, recalling the self-proclaimed activist’s provocative acts and attacks against Morocco over the past months and years.
In his letter, Hilale emphasized that  Khaya has publicly called for an armed conflict in Morocco’s southern provinces, emphasizing that she has been making trips to Algeria where she received military training on the use of firearms and participated in military exercises.
The latest military camp training that Khaya took part in was from January 1-12 in 2019.  Footage and pictures later emerged of the hardline Polisario militant -- and self-described human rights activist -- holding a firearm and calling for war against Morocco. The footage went viral instantly,  prompting many questions about Khaya’s self-presentation as a pacifist human rights activist.
Polisario and Algeria finance Khaya with a monthly stipend of €4,300 to serve their agenda in her capacity as president of a non-registered association under the “Sahrawi league for the defense of human rights,” Hilale said in his letters to the UN Security Council.
“[Khaya] has a Moroccan passport and travels freely and regularly abroad, where she indulges [in criticizing the] human rights situation in Morocco without being bothered or arrested by the Moroccan authorities on her return,” the ambassador argued.

Khaya is one of the most controversial members of the Polisario Front. Just last year, as news circulated of her links to an armed branch of the separatist Polisario Front, the European Parliament excluded Khaya’s candidacy from the list of finalists for the 2021 Sakharov Prize, an award presented to individuals who have dedicated their lives to the defense of human rights.
Despite claiming to be a champion of human rights and a fierce chronicler of abuse in Morocco’s southern provinces, Khaya refused to meet a delegation from Morocco’s Human Rights Council (CNDH) in February. 
The delegation, which had traveled to the southern provinces to investigate allegations of human rights violations in the region, visited the Polisario militant at her home in Boujdour for an interview.
Morocco has long warned about Khaya’s hostile maneuvers in several letters to the UN Security Council.
In November 2021, Ambassador Hilale sent a letter to the UN body, detailing Khaya’s involvement with an armed branch of the separatist Polisario Front, and asking rhetorically: “With regard to the so-called Sultana Khaya, in particular, it is worth wondering since when have human rights activists been in military training, with the Kalashnikov slung over their shoulders?”

3,"Minister: Spain Wants to Preserve Ties with ‘Reliable, Fraternal’ Morocco","Since endorsing Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara, Madrid has repeatedly renewed its readiness to deepen ties with Rabat.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 07, 2022 5:02 p.m.","Rabat - Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has reiterated his country’s commitment to preserving relations with Morocco.
Calling Morocco a “reliable and fraternal” country, Marlaska stressed that Rabat and Madrid have long preserved their cooperation and diplomatic ties, and will continue to do so as they commit to a new roadmap to deepen their strategic alliance.
""Our relations with Morocco are extremely loyal, reliable, and fraternal,"" Grande-Marlaska told the press on Tuesday.
He maintained that his country's relations with Morocco will continue to “deepen” following the visit of his Government Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco in April.
Sanchez met with King Mohammed VI during his Moroccan visit, and the two leaders issued a joint declaration to announce a new roadmap to improve diplomatic relations after a year-long tension between Madrid and Rabat.
The tension broke out in April 2021 after Spain decided to host the Polisario Front leader, Brahim Ghali for hospitalization. It ended in March this year after Spain announced its full endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara
“Our desire is to deepen our important relations, based on mutual trust and geared towards the 21st century,” Grande-Marlaska said today, echoing similar remarks the Spanish government spokeswoman, Isabelle Rodriguez, made on Monday.
“We can congratulate ourselves because this new step is proving to be very positive,” Rodriguez said.
Amid positive remarks regarding the Morocco-Spain cooperation, former Spain’s foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya attacked Morocco in a recent interview with Spanish news outlet El Periodico
As the head of Spanish diplomacy during the Ghali episode, Laya has been described as the main instigator of the year-long feud between Madrid and Rabat. 
And when she was finally sacked in July of last year, just three months into the then raging Spain-Morocco fallout, reports in the Spanish media suggested that Pedro Sanchez  “sacrificed” Laya in an attempt to appease Morocco.
In her recent interview, Laya defended the decision to receive Ghali for hospitalization, describing it as a  humanitarian move “towards a Spanish citizen who needed immediate help.”

4,Saudi Arabia Engages in ‘Serious Talks’ With Israel For Potential Normalization,Many have suggested normalization of ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel is just a matter of time.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 07, 2022 2:14 p.m.","Rabat - Saudi Arabia and Israel are involved in “serious talks” to establish ties and boost cooperation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, noting the  Biden administration's efforts to pave the way for another Abraham Accord with Saudi Arabia.
“Although Saudi Arabia doesn’t recognize Israel and has no diplomatic relations with its neighbor, the kingdom is expanding its secretive talks with Israeli leaders,” the report said, stressing that such talks could reshape Middle East politics and end “decades of enmity” between the two influential countries.
The report comes less than a month after the Saudi government reitrated its unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in late May, the Saudi foreign affairs minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said that the normalization of ties with Israel cannot happen until a peaceful resolution regarding the Palestinian cause is reached.
In his Davos remarks, the top Saudi diplomat notably commented on the murder by Israeli forces of prominent Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.
The journalist was killed on May 11, sparking outrage and uproar about the international community’s silence and inaction amid Israeli violations against Palestinians.
Despite the comments from the chief of Saudi diplomacy, Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said on May 30 that his country is engaged in talks with the US and Gulf Arab countries to explore the “normalization of diplomatic relations” with Saudi Arabia.
Even as he acknowledged that the normalization path with Saudi Arabia remains rocky, Lapid spoke optimistically of a potential agreement between Riyadh and Tel Aviv.  
The Israeli FM’s optimism appears to have been backed by countless reports in the past weeks that the Biden administration is actively pushing to facilitate the normalization of ties between the Saudi and Israeli governments.
Although Saudi Arabia and Israel have no official diplomatic relations, recent developments -- especially reports of the Saudi Crown Prince investing tens of millions of dollars into two Israeli startups -- have led many to suggest that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries may just be a matter of time.

5,Spain Satisfied with ‘Positive Results’ of New Diplomatic Roadmap With Morocco,Madrid says it is committed to moving forward in strengthening relations with Rabat and consolidating a mutually win-win partnership.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 06, 2022 5:47 p.m.","Rabat - Spain has said it is satisfied with the positive results that have been achieved since it agreed to a “new roadmap” to improve relations with Morocco.
“We can congratulate ourselves because this new step proves to be very positive, “ Spain’s government spokeswoman Isabel Rodriquez told Spanish television channel TVE on Monday, adding that Madrid and Rabat have welcomed the positive results of the new roadmap, which “made possible progress on many bilateral issues of common interest.”
Morocco and Spain announced the new roadmap to improve bilateral relations after their long-standing “strategic partnership” took a blow in April 2021 when Madrid hosted Polisario leader Brahim Ghali. 
With Morocco describing Spain’s Ghali gaffe as a betrayal and an unacceptable breach of the reciprocity principle, relations between the two countries experienced an unprecedented low for over a year. 
Following months of behind-the-scenes dialogue and negotiations, Morocco agreed to reconcile with its European ally after Spain announced its endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara. 
The official endorsement, which described the Moroccan plan as the most serious and credible proposal to end the Sahara dispute, was followed by a visit to Morocco of Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
Traveling to the North African country in April, Sanchez met with King Mohammed VI and made a commitment to opening a “new chapter” of diplomatic relations based on unwavering reciprocity and transparency.  
Following their meeting, the Moroccan monarch and the Spanish head of government issued a joint declaration announcing a “new roadmap” aimed at transcending the Ghali incident to lay the ground for a new friendship based on mutual trust and support for each other’s strategic interests. 
Invoking the spirit of the joint declaration in her TVE appearance, Rodriguez stressed that Spain is committed to moving forward in strengthening relations with Morocco and consolidating a mutually win-win partnership.
She said, “We continue to progress in the roadmap that was established with Morocco to improve the neighborhood relationship, particularly progress on issues important to our countries, such as immigration, economy, and security.”

6,Algeria Sentences Brother of Ex-President Bouteflika to 8 Years,"While already serving a 15-year sentence, Said Bouteflika was again tried last week on charges of influence peddling, abuse of power, and money laundering.",Sara Zouiten,"June 06, 2022 5:25 p.m.","Rabat - An Algerian court sentenced on Monday Said Bouteflika, the younger brother of the late former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to eight years in prison for corruption. Said is already serving a 15-year sentence for alleged conspiracy and contempt of public authority.
Said’s co-accused, Algerian businessman Ali Haddad, was also convicted in several cases and was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the same trial.
According to local news outlets, the two defendants appeared before the Sidi M’hamed court in Algiers on charges of influence peddling, abuse of power, money laundering, and not declaring property.  
Said Bouteflika and Ali Haddad were also sentenced to pay a fine of DZD 3 million ($ 20,669) each to the Treasury.
In 2019, an Algerian military court sentenced Said to 15 years in prison for “attacking the authority of the army"" and ""conspiracy against the authority of the state.""
Said had been considered to be Algeria’s de facto ruler following his brother’s stroke in 2013.

Haddad was sentenced to a total of 20 years in prison in other corruption and money laundering cases in March 2020, November 2020, and January 2021. He was sentenced to four years, 12 years, and another four years, respectively.
In October 2021, Said and Haddad were each sentenced to two years in prison for “obstructing justice.”
Following Bouteflika’s fall on April 2, 2019, under pressure from the Hirak protest movement, the Algerian justice system launched a series of investigations into cases involving members of the late president’s entourage, including his family members, politicians, and businessmen.
Hirak started on February 22, 2019, with Algerians denouncing widespread corruption among the country’s political elite and calling for accountability.
Protestors demanded radical change within the entire “corrupt system,” and the dismissal of all government officials from Bouteflika’s era - from 1999 to 2019.
Former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika died at the age of 84 on September 17, 2021, after enduring years of ill health.

7,India Faces Backlash Over Officials’ Derogatory Comments About Islam,Critics and watchers of India maintain that Islamophobia has been on the rise in the country since the Hindu nationalist party BJP took the helm in 2014.,Aya Benazizi,"June 06, 2022 5:05 p.m.","Rabat - India is facing a major diplomatic backlash from Muslim-majority countries after top officials from the country’s ruling Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made derogatory remarks about Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.
The senior officials’ blasphemous comments drew the ire of many Arab countries, leaving New Delhi scrambling to limit the harmful impact of the country’s latest anti-Islam scandal.
In response to the offensive, Islamophobic comments by senior BJP officials Nupur Sharma and Naveen Kumar Jindal, a number of Arab countries have submitted official objections against India. 
The outpouring of outrage began last week when the two BJP members made remarks that were seen as insulting to Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha.
During a televised debate on the vexed Gyanvapi mosque controversy, Sharma made derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha’s age. 
Her remarks sparked controversy, prompting multiple protests from Muslim groups in India, with reports later indicating that around 40 individuals, including police officers, were hurt during the protests in the city of Kanpur. 
Several First Information Reports (FIR) were filed against Sharma for infringing on religious emotions during her now-notorious television debate. The first FIR was registered by the Mumbai Police at the behest of the Islamist group Raza Academy, while the second was filed on June 1 by the Mumbra police in Thane based on a complaint by Mohammad Gufran Khan, a school teacher.

After being expelled from BJP, Sharma issued an apology on Sunday, stressing that her intention was not to hurt anyone. “If my words have caused discomfort or hurt religious feelings of anyone whatsoever, I hereby unconditionally withdraw my statement,” she said in a tweet.
Jindal, for his part, made provocative statements about Prophet Muhammad on Twitter on June 1. In response, social media users launched a campaign on Twitter under the hashtag “Arrest Naveen Jindal.” Faced with a torrent of backlash, the BJP official later deleted his tweet.
After he was suspended from the BJP, Jindal posted another tweet yesterday urging everyone to not make his address public as he was getting death threats on social media. “I have a special request to all, please do not make my address public, threats to kill me and my family are being given continuously on social media too,” he said.
Amid the social media melee, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran have all requested an apology from India’s government for tolerating insulting, anti-Islam statements from senior officials of the country’s ruling political party.
The BJP did not take any action against Jindal and Sharma until Sunday, after the governments of Qatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Iran summoned Indian ambassadors in their respective countries for clarification. 
In a bid to assuage the backlash it has been experiencing on the diplomatic front, India’s ruling, Hindu nationalist party banned Sharma and expelled Jindal. The party notably issued an unusual statement in which it “strongly denounces disrespect to any religious personalities,” a decision that Qatar and Kuwait applauded.
In addition to the strong condemnation by governments of Muslim-majority countries, many on social media have launched campaigns calling to boycott Indian products as a way of expressing their anger toward the Indian government for accommodating anti-Islam sentiments.
According to Al Jazeera, Indian products were removed from shelves in certain Kuwaiti shops on Monday.
Aggressive reactions to aggressive statements
Because offending Prophet Muhammad is a red line for Muslims, Muslim-majority countries were outraged by India’s offensive Islamophobic statements.
Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Soltan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi warned in a statement that “these insulting remarks would lead to incitement of religious hatred, and offend more than two billion Muslims around the world.”
Meanwhile, Kuwait cautioned that if the statements were not punished, India would experience “an increase of extremism and hatred.”
Doha, on the other hand, is expecting “a public apology and immediate condemnation of these remarks” from the Indian government.
Saudi Arabia and Iran also submitted complaints with India, while the Jeddha-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation stated the statements came in a “context of intensifying hatred and abuse toward Islam in India and systematic practices against Muslims.”
Pakistan, for its part, summoned an Indian envoy on Monday to express Islamabad’s “strong condemnation.” This came a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif claimed the BJP officials’ remarks were “hurtful” and that “India under [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi is trampling religious liberties and harassing Muslims.”
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said in a statement: “These insults come in the context of the increasing intensity in hatred of and insults to Islam in India and the systematic harassment of Muslims.” 
So far, New Delhi has made no comment on the Arab states’ objections, but the Indian Foreign Ministry on Monday dismissed the OIC’s views as “unwarranted” and “narrow-minded.”
The Indian embassies in Qatar and Doha issued a statement on Sunday, saying that harsh measures had already been taken against individuals who made the disparaging remarks against Islam. Both declarations notably insisted that the sentiments voiced against the Prophet Muhammad and Islam were not those of the Indian government and were expressed by “fringe elements.”

8,"Ceuta-Melilla: Spain, Morocco To Discuss Full Reopening of Borders",Morocco and Spain agreed to open their borders immediately after King Mohammed VI and the Spanish PM met in April.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 06, 2022 2:59 p.m.","Rabat - Spain and Morocco will meet on Tuesday to discuss the complete reopening of the Moroccan borders with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.
Inter-ministerial delegations from the two countries will meet to discuss the schedule for completing the process of “normalizing the movement of people and goods,” Spanish news outlet El Pais quoted sources from the Spanish government as saying.
The meeting is in line with the joint declaration Madrid and Rabat issued following the visit of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco.
During his Moroccan visit, the Spanish PM met with King Mohammed VI as part of the two countries' newfound determination to open a new phase of cooperation to end a year-long diplomatic crisis.
Under the joint declaration, Morocco and Spain agreed to open their borders immediately after the meeting between the King of Morocco and Sanchez.
While Moroccan borders with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla reopened on May 17,  the reopening is taking place gradually.
For now, however, only Spanish citizens and foreigners with a residence permit and a Schengen visa are allowed to access or leave the enclaves.
On May 31, the passage was reopened for cross-border workers in Morocco. 
But “almost none [of the workers] were able to go to the Spanish enclaves, since they lacked a visa,” according to El Pais.

Official sources quoted by the Spanish news outlet  did not, however, clarify “whether the schedule to be agreed upon” will include the reopening of the commercial customs office in Melilla or the opening of a commercial customs office in Ceuta that “has never existed until now.”
Moroccan cross-border workers have been protesting near the borders with the Spanish enclaves, asking for the reopening of crossing points that have been closed for over two years due to COVID-19.
In addition to the outbreak of the pandemic, the smuggling of counterfeit goods into Morocco from Ceuta and Melilla is another reason why the North African country decided to close its borders with the two enclaves.
Despite the reopening of borders, the Moroccan government has maintained that the resumption of movement between Morocco and the two enclaves will not reverse its stance on stamping out the smuggling of counterfeits.

9,UN To Cut Food Rations to Sahrawis in Tindouf by 50%,A UN World Food Program official says the decision is due to the notable increase in grain prices amid the Ukraine-Russia conflict.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 06, 2022 2:24 p.m.","Rabat - The UN is planning to cut by 50% food rations directed to Sahrawis living in the Polisario-run camps in Tindouf, the westernmost province in Algeria.
Citing the UN World Food Program, the Spanish news outlet EFE reported that the decision to cut food rations directed to Sahrawis is due to “higher grain prices and freight rates.”
EFE’s report quoted a spokesperson for the UN World Food Program as saying that acute hunger is projected to increase by 47 million people if the conflict in Ukraine does not end.
“This represents an increase of 17 percent, being the most pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa,” the spokesperson said, adding that the cutting of food rations will also impact countries in the Sahel region.
The news is set to compound the Tindouf camps’ long-running malnutrition crisis,  with recent reports by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, having repeatedly outlined the prevalence of acute hunger in the Polisario-run camps.
In his October 2021 report, Guterres expressed concerns about hunger and malnutrition in Tindouf.
Over the years, UN-affiliated organizations have struggled to meet the needs of refugees and improve food security and nutrition in the Tindouf camps.

The UNHCR, UNICEF, and WFP received only 58% of their combined resource needs for their regular programs in 2020.
Several reports have linked malnutrition in the region to the embezzlement of humanitarian aid -- including food packages and funds -- meant for distressed refugees by the Polisario leadership.
In a revealing report in October 2021, the Tindouf-based Autonomy Support Forum (FORSATIN) considered Polisario’s mismanagement and misappropriation of humanitarian aid as the main factor behind the severe health crisis in the camps.
The “smuggling” of medical equipment and food supplies meant for refugees has long caused acute malnutrition and other health concerns in the Polisario-controlled, FORSATIN documented.
“As soon as they [aid packages] arrive and are pictured, these devices evaporate as if they never existed,” noted the report, adding that the shortage of medicines has been one of the camps’ festering issues despite yearly supplies from UN agencies and other relief NGOs.
Even pro-Polisario websites like Futuro Sahara have on occasion reported on the chronic embezzlement of humanitarian aid meant for Sahrawi refugees.
In 2018, Futuro Sahara revealed that food packs and other relief items sent to the Polisario-run camps mostly end up in Algerian grocery stores.
In an even more damning report in 2015, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) exposed a scandal about the selling and the embezzlement of international aid intended for Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. 
Covering the 2003-2007 period, the report documented how, amid widespread cases of malnutrition, poor health, and a large shortage of foodstuffs in the Tindouf camps, senior Polisario officials chose instead to sell EU relief products in Mauritanian and Sub-Saharan markets.

10,King Mohammed VI Departs on Private Trip to France,"The king of Morocco is expected to stay at his palace in Betz, a small town located 40 kilometers from Paris.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 03, 2022 11:03 a.m.","Rabat - King Mohammed VI is reportedly visiting France on a private trip, sources told news outlet Jeune Afrique.
The Moroccan monarch flew to France on Wednesday, June 1, the news outlet quoted a source close to the royal palace as saying.
The visit would be the first of its kind for the king of Morocco since the outbreak of COVID-19 and its induced traveling restrictions.
Amid the king’s visit to France, Jeune Afrique indicated that the two countries' relations suffered ups and downs since the election of Emmanuel Macron in 2017.
The news outlet referred to the French decision to reduce the number of visas issued to people from North Africa, including Morocco.
Morocco described France’s decision to limit the number of visas issued to Moroccans as “unjustified.”
Jeune Afrique suggested that King Mohammed VI is staying in his palace in Betz. Several reports shed light on the castle, often described as King Mohammed VI’s vacation palace.
In 2017, French television news outlet France 3 published a report dubbed “The King of Morocco and Betz, a story of generosity.”
During the report, France 3 emphasized the positive impact of King Mohammed VI’s visits to  Betz, a small village located 40 kilometers from Paris.
 “The King’s arrival cannot go unnoticed during his visits to the area because of the important security measures put in place during his stay in the small village,” explains France 3.
The report said that when the king of Morocco visited the region, he “brings with his employment.”
The report cited statements from locals, including grocery managers in the town.
Angelique Vetu, the manager of a small grocery shop in Betz, told France 3 that “[the King’s] priority is to make people work here in all sectors.” She added that many people see the King’s stay in the castle of Betz as a sign of generosity.

11,Spain Will Not Participate in 2022 African Lion Military Exercises,Spain was similarly absent from the 2021 military maneuvers amid diplomatic tensions between Rabat and Madrid.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 03, 2022 10:44 a.m.","Rabat - The 2022 African Lion, one of the largest and key military exercises in Africa, will mark the absence of Spain’s troops for the second year in a row.
Spanish news outlet EFE quoted military and diplomatic sources, suggesting that the Spanish military will not take part in the maneuver. The sources did not, however, unveil the reasons behind Spain’s alleged absence from the 2022 African Lion exercise.
More than 7,000 US troops will participate in the military training along with military forces from Morocco in addition to several countries.
The vast military exercises will take place in different places in Morocco, including Tan Tan, Mehbes, Taroudant, Ben Guerir near Marrakech, and Kenitra near Rabat.
Part of the military exercises will also take place in Tunisia, Senegal, and Ghana.
In 2021, Spain was also absent from the 2021 African Lion exercise amid unprecedented tension with Morocco.
In May 2021, Spanish news outlet El Pais said that Spain refused to participate in military exercises.
The Spanish media emphasized that the European country declined the US invitation, citing budgetary reasons.
El Pais quoted Spanish sources, claiming that the declined invitation was because “part of these exercises, in which Spain has participated every year, will be held for the first time in Western Sahara.”
In 2021, Spain prompted Moroccan backlash after hosting Polisario leader Brahim Ghali, who traveled to the European country using a fake passport and identity under the name of Mohamed Ben Battouch.
The visit to Spain was for hospitalization purposes. Yet Spain’s decision, and the failure to inform its southern neighbor of the decision, angered Morocco, which described the move from its European ally as against the spirit of partnership.
Morocco then recalled its ambassador to Madrid.
Following months of dialogue and Spanish attempts to mend ties, Morocco agreed to open a new phase of diplomatic relations with the European country.
This new phase followed Spain’s decision to officially endorse Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara.

Cordero is set to meet with Naama Mayara, President of the Moroccan Chamber of Councillors, to discuss prospects of reinforcing coordination and consultation between the countries’ parliaments and public institutions. 
Accompanying Cordero will be Hector Vasconcelos, the President of the Mexican Senate’s Exterior Relations Commission, and Cora Cecilia Pinedo Alonso, President of the Exterior Relations Commission for Asia, Pacific, and Africa. 
Over the past two years, Morocco and Mexico have expressed shared interest in strengthening south-south cooperation at the diplomatic, economic, and cultural levels despite the Mexican recognition and support of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). 
The Mexican rapprochement with SADR was officialized in 1979 with the recognition of former Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda y Alvarez de la Rosa of the separatist entity as a state.  
While the statement reporting Cordero’s visit does not mention Western Sahara, there is potential that the disputed region will be at the center of the upcoming meeting.

Mexican officials and the Mexico-Morocco Friendship Group have repeatedly called for better trade and diplomatic relations to best represent the 60 years of diplomatic ties connecting Rabat and Mexico City. 
These relations will be celebrated by the Moroccan Embassy in Mexico during a one-week event that will provide a wide selection of artistic cultural events and economic forums from July 23 and 31. 
Beyond the celebrations, the Mexico-Morocco Friendship Group has urged Mexican and Latin American governments to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the ""one and only"" solution to the Western Sahara dispute. 
The group has been vocally pro-Moroccan on numerous occasions with regard to developments in Western Sahara, such as the intervention of the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces in the El Guergarat zone to restore civil and commercial traffic between the region and Mauritania. 
Currently, the Mexico-Morocco Friendship Group’s call for the official recognition of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara remains unanswered. In Rabat, however, there is discernible hope that the international wave in support of the Moroccan stance on Western Sahara and the latest rapprochement between the two countries might influence decision-makers in the South American country.

13,Spanish PM Renews Support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan Amid Hostile Campaign,A number of marginal opposition political parties in Spain are taking issue with the Sanchez government’s endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 08, 2022 2:02 p.m.","Rabat - Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has once again renewed his country’s support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.
Appearing at a Congress meeting today, Sanchez insisted that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the “most serious, credible, and realistic basis” to resolve the dispute over Western Sahara.
“We need a consensus exit,” the Spanish PM added, emphasizing that his country continues to support the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable and agreed upon solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara.
Sanchez’s remarks come in response to the hostile campaign a number of marginal opposition parties have launched to put pressure on the government following Spain’s official endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
In addition to the campaign from some MPs supporting Polisario’s claims, Algeria and the separatist group of the Polisario Front continue to release strongly-worded statements in an attempt to convince Spain to reverse its support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal.
In March, Algeria’s government recalled its ambassador to Madrid in protest of Spain’s support for the Moroccan initiative for Western Sahara.
In a telling statement following Spain’s decision in favor of the Moroccan plan, the Algerian government said that it was “surprised” and “astonished,” and it notably threatened to review its gas deal with Spain.

Spain, however, responded to such protests by emphasizing that although it shared good diplomatic relations with Algeria, the North African country had no rights to question, or interfere with Madrid’s “sovereign decision” to support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. 
In April, Spanish FM Jose Manuel Albares emphasized his government’s support of the Moroccan stance on the Sahara question, saying that Madrid had “nothing to add” to its embrace of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
Albares’ remarks angered Algerian officials who described his comments as “derogatory, offensive, and unacceptable.”
Such statements will “certainly not contribute to a rapid return to normal in bilateral relations,” said Amar Belani, whom Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune recently appointed as Algeria’s “special envoy in charge of Western Sahara.”
Spain, however, has repeatedly expressed its determination to preserve its strategic partnership with Morocco.
The latest statement of unwavering support came from Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska who on Tuesday called Morocco a “reliable and fraternal country,” adding: “Our relations with Morocco are extremely loyal.”

14,Moroccan Ambassador: Polisario’s Sultana Khaya is Not a Human Rights Defender,"While presenting herself as a pacifist champion of human rights, Sultana Khaya has been recorded and photographed while holding rifles and calling for war against Morocco.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 08, 2022 11:10 a.m.","Rabat - The Permanent Representative of Morocco to the UN, Omar Hilale, has accused Algeria of hiring Polisario members such as Sultana Khaya to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity.
Hilale addressed a series of letters to the Security Council to expose how Khaya’s maneuvers serve the agenda of the Polisario Front and their biggest supporter, Algeria.
“Sultana Khaya is in no way a defender of human rights, but indeed an agent working for Algeria and the Polisario,” said the Moroccan ambassador, recalling the self-proclaimed activist’s provocative acts and attacks against Morocco over the past months and years.
In his letter, Hilale emphasized that  Khaya has publicly called for an armed conflict in Morocco’s southern provinces, emphasizing that she has been making trips to Algeria where she received military training on the use of firearms and participated in military exercises.
The latest military camp training that Khaya took part in was from January 1-12 in 2019.  Footage and pictures later emerged of the hardline Polisario militant -- and self-described human rights activist -- holding a firearm and calling for war against Morocco. The footage went viral instantly,  prompting many questions about Khaya’s self-presentation as a pacifist human rights activist.
Polisario and Algeria finance Khaya with a monthly stipend of €4,300 to serve their agenda in her capacity as president of a non-registered association under the “Sahrawi league for the defense of human rights,” Hilale said in his letters to the UN Security Council.
“[Khaya] has a Moroccan passport and travels freely and regularly abroad, where she indulges [in criticizing the] human rights situation in Morocco without being bothered or arrested by the Moroccan authorities on her return,” the ambassador argued.

Khaya is one of the most controversial members of the Polisario Front. Just last year, as news circulated of her links to an armed branch of the separatist Polisario Front, the European Parliament excluded Khaya’s candidacy from the list of finalists for the 2021 Sakharov Prize, an award presented to individuals who have dedicated their lives to the defense of human rights.
Despite claiming to be a champion of human rights and a fierce chronicler of abuse in Morocco’s southern provinces, Khaya refused to meet a delegation from Morocco’s Human Rights Council (CNDH) in February. 
The delegation, which had traveled to the southern provinces to investigate allegations of human rights violations in the region, visited the Polisario militant at her home in Boujdour for an interview.
Morocco has long warned about Khaya’s hostile maneuvers in several letters to the UN Security Council.
In November 2021, Ambassador Hilale sent a letter to the UN body, detailing Khaya’s involvement with an armed branch of the separatist Polisario Front, and asking rhetorically: “With regard to the so-called Sultana Khaya, in particular, it is worth wondering since when have human rights activists been in military training, with the Kalashnikov slung over their shoulders?”

15,"Minister: Spain Wants to Preserve Ties with ‘Reliable, Fraternal’ Morocco","Since endorsing Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara, Madrid has repeatedly renewed its readiness to deepen ties with Rabat.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 07, 2022 5:02 p.m.","Rabat - Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has reiterated his country’s commitment to preserving relations with Morocco.
Calling Morocco a “reliable and fraternal” country, Marlaska stressed that Rabat and Madrid have long preserved their cooperation and diplomatic ties, and will continue to do so as they commit to a new roadmap to deepen their strategic alliance.
""Our relations with Morocco are extremely loyal, reliable, and fraternal,"" Grande-Marlaska told the press on Tuesday.
He maintained that his country's relations with Morocco will continue to “deepen” following the visit of his Government Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco in April.
Sanchez met with King Mohammed VI during his Moroccan visit, and the two leaders issued a joint declaration to announce a new roadmap to improve diplomatic relations after a year-long tension between Madrid and Rabat.
The tension broke out in April 2021 after Spain decided to host the Polisario Front leader, Brahim Ghali for hospitalization. It ended in March this year after Spain announced its full endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara
“Our desire is to deepen our important relations, based on mutual trust and geared towards the 21st century,” Grande-Marlaska said today, echoing similar remarks the Spanish government spokeswoman, Isabelle Rodriguez, made on Monday.
“We can congratulate ourselves because this new step is proving to be very positive,” Rodriguez said.
Amid positive remarks regarding the Morocco-Spain cooperation, former Spain’s foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya attacked Morocco in a recent interview with Spanish news outlet El Periodico
As the head of Spanish diplomacy during the Ghali episode, Laya has been described as the main instigator of the year-long feud between Madrid and Rabat. 
And when she was finally sacked in July of last year, just three months into the then raging Spain-Morocco fallout, reports in the Spanish media suggested that Pedro Sanchez  “sacrificed” Laya in an attempt to appease Morocco.
In her recent interview, Laya defended the decision to receive Ghali for hospitalization, describing it as a  humanitarian move “towards a Spanish citizen who needed immediate help.”

16,Saudi Arabia Engages in ‘Serious Talks’ With Israel For Potential Normalization,Many have suggested normalization of ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel is just a matter of time.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 07, 2022 2:14 p.m.","Rabat - Saudi Arabia and Israel are involved in “serious talks” to establish ties and boost cooperation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, noting the  Biden administration's efforts to pave the way for another Abraham Accord with Saudi Arabia.
“Although Saudi Arabia doesn’t recognize Israel and has no diplomatic relations with its neighbor, the kingdom is expanding its secretive talks with Israeli leaders,” the report said, stressing that such talks could reshape Middle East politics and end “decades of enmity” between the two influential countries.
The report comes less than a month after the Saudi government reitrated its unwavering support for the Palestinian cause.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in late May, the Saudi foreign affairs minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said that the normalization of ties with Israel cannot happen until a peaceful resolution regarding the Palestinian cause is reached.
In his Davos remarks, the top Saudi diplomat notably commented on the murder by Israeli forces of prominent Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.
The journalist was killed on May 11, sparking outrage and uproar about the international community’s silence and inaction amid Israeli violations against Palestinians.
Despite the comments from the chief of Saudi diplomacy, Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said on May 30 that his country is engaged in talks with the US and Gulf Arab countries to explore the “normalization of diplomatic relations” with Saudi Arabia.
Even as he acknowledged that the normalization path with Saudi Arabia remains rocky, Lapid spoke optimistically of a potential agreement between Riyadh and Tel Aviv.  
The Israeli FM’s optimism appears to have been backed by countless reports in the past weeks that the Biden administration is actively pushing to facilitate the normalization of ties between the Saudi and Israeli governments.
Although Saudi Arabia and Israel have no official diplomatic relations, recent developments -- especially reports of the Saudi Crown Prince investing tens of millions of dollars into two Israeli startups -- have led many to suggest that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries may just be a matter of time.

17,Spain Satisfied with ‘Positive Results’ of New Diplomatic Roadmap With Morocco,Madrid says it is committed to moving forward in strengthening relations with Rabat and consolidating a mutually win-win partnership.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 06, 2022 5:47 p.m.","Rabat - Spain has said it is satisfied with the positive results that have been achieved since it agreed to a “new roadmap” to improve relations with Morocco.
“We can congratulate ourselves because this new step proves to be very positive, “ Spain’s government spokeswoman Isabel Rodriquez told Spanish television channel TVE on Monday, adding that Madrid and Rabat have welcomed the positive results of the new roadmap, which “made possible progress on many bilateral issues of common interest.”
Morocco and Spain announced the new roadmap to improve bilateral relations after their long-standing “strategic partnership” took a blow in April 2021 when Madrid hosted Polisario leader Brahim Ghali. 
With Morocco describing Spain’s Ghali gaffe as a betrayal and an unacceptable breach of the reciprocity principle, relations between the two countries experienced an unprecedented low for over a year. 
Following months of behind-the-scenes dialogue and negotiations, Morocco agreed to reconcile with its European ally after Spain announced its endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara. 
The official endorsement, which described the Moroccan plan as the most serious and credible proposal to end the Sahara dispute, was followed by a visit to Morocco of Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
Traveling to the North African country in April, Sanchez met with King Mohammed VI and made a commitment to opening a “new chapter” of diplomatic relations based on unwavering reciprocity and transparency.  
Following their meeting, the Moroccan monarch and the Spanish head of government issued a joint declaration announcing a “new roadmap” aimed at transcending the Ghali incident to lay the ground for a new friendship based on mutual trust and support for each other’s strategic interests. 
Invoking the spirit of the joint declaration in her TVE appearance, Rodriguez stressed that Spain is committed to moving forward in strengthening relations with Morocco and consolidating a mutually win-win partnership.
She said, “We continue to progress in the roadmap that was established with Morocco to improve the neighborhood relationship, particularly progress on issues important to our countries, such as immigration, economy, and security.”

18,Algeria Sentences Brother of Ex-President Bouteflika to 8 Years,"While already serving a 15-year sentence, Said Bouteflika was again tried last week on charges of influence peddling, abuse of power, and money laundering.",Sara Zouiten,"June 06, 2022 5:25 p.m.","Rabat - An Algerian court sentenced on Monday Said Bouteflika, the younger brother of the late former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to eight years in prison for corruption. Said is already serving a 15-year sentence for alleged conspiracy and contempt of public authority.
Said’s co-accused, Algerian businessman Ali Haddad, was also convicted in several cases and was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the same trial.
According to local news outlets, the two defendants appeared before the Sidi M’hamed court in Algiers on charges of influence peddling, abuse of power, money laundering, and not declaring property.  
Said Bouteflika and Ali Haddad were also sentenced to pay a fine of DZD 3 million ($ 20,669) each to the Treasury.
In 2019, an Algerian military court sentenced Said to 15 years in prison for “attacking the authority of the army"" and ""conspiracy against the authority of the state.""
Said had been considered to be Algeria’s de facto ruler following his brother’s stroke in 2013.

Haddad was sentenced to a total of 20 years in prison in other corruption and money laundering cases in March 2020, November 2020, and January 2021. He was sentenced to four years, 12 years, and another four years, respectively.
In October 2021, Said and Haddad were each sentenced to two years in prison for “obstructing justice.”
Following Bouteflika’s fall on April 2, 2019, under pressure from the Hirak protest movement, the Algerian justice system launched a series of investigations into cases involving members of the late president’s entourage, including his family members, politicians, and businessmen.
Hirak started on February 22, 2019, with Algerians denouncing widespread corruption among the country’s political elite and calling for accountability.
Protestors demanded radical change within the entire “corrupt system,” and the dismissal of all government officials from Bouteflika’s era - from 1999 to 2019.
Former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika died at the age of 84 on September 17, 2021, after enduring years of ill health.

19,India Faces Backlash Over Officials’ Derogatory Comments About Islam,Critics and watchers of India maintain that Islamophobia has been on the rise in the country since the Hindu nationalist party BJP took the helm in 2014.,Aya Benazizi,"June 06, 2022 5:05 p.m.","Rabat - India is facing a major diplomatic backlash from Muslim-majority countries after top officials from the country’s ruling Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made derogatory remarks about Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.
The senior officials’ blasphemous comments drew the ire of many Arab countries, leaving New Delhi scrambling to limit the harmful impact of the country’s latest anti-Islam scandal.
In response to the offensive, Islamophobic comments by senior BJP officials Nupur Sharma and Naveen Kumar Jindal, a number of Arab countries have submitted official objections against India. 
The outpouring of outrage began last week when the two BJP members made remarks that were seen as insulting to Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha.
During a televised debate on the vexed Gyanvapi mosque controversy, Sharma made derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha’s age. 
Her remarks sparked controversy, prompting multiple protests from Muslim groups in India, with reports later indicating that around 40 individuals, including police officers, were hurt during the protests in the city of Kanpur. 
Several First Information Reports (FIR) were filed against Sharma for infringing on religious emotions during her now-notorious television debate. The first FIR was registered by the Mumbai Police at the behest of the Islamist group Raza Academy, while the second was filed on June 1 by the Mumbra police in Thane based on a complaint by Mohammad Gufran Khan, a school teacher.

After being expelled from BJP, Sharma issued an apology on Sunday, stressing that her intention was not to hurt anyone. “If my words have caused discomfort or hurt religious feelings of anyone whatsoever, I hereby unconditionally withdraw my statement,” she said in a tweet.
Jindal, for his part, made provocative statements about Prophet Muhammad on Twitter on June 1. In response, social media users launched a campaign on Twitter under the hashtag “Arrest Naveen Jindal.” Faced with a torrent of backlash, the BJP official later deleted his tweet.
After he was suspended from the BJP, Jindal posted another tweet yesterday urging everyone to not make his address public as he was getting death threats on social media. “I have a special request to all, please do not make my address public, threats to kill me and my family are being given continuously on social media too,” he said.
Amid the social media melee, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran have all requested an apology from India’s government for tolerating insulting, anti-Islam statements from senior officials of the country’s ruling political party.
The BJP did not take any action against Jindal and Sharma until Sunday, after the governments of Qatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Iran summoned Indian ambassadors in their respective countries for clarification. 
In a bid to assuage the backlash it has been experiencing on the diplomatic front, India’s ruling, Hindu nationalist party banned Sharma and expelled Jindal. The party notably issued an unusual statement in which it “strongly denounces disrespect to any religious personalities,” a decision that Qatar and Kuwait applauded.
In addition to the strong condemnation by governments of Muslim-majority countries, many on social media have launched campaigns calling to boycott Indian products as a way of expressing their anger toward the Indian government for accommodating anti-Islam sentiments.
According to Al Jazeera, Indian products were removed from shelves in certain Kuwaiti shops on Monday.
Aggressive reactions to aggressive statements
Because offending Prophet Muhammad is a red line for Muslims, Muslim-majority countries were outraged by India’s offensive Islamophobic statements.
Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Soltan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi warned in a statement that “these insulting remarks would lead to incitement of religious hatred, and offend more than two billion Muslims around the world.”
Meanwhile, Kuwait cautioned that if the statements were not punished, India would experience “an increase of extremism and hatred.”
Doha, on the other hand, is expecting “a public apology and immediate condemnation of these remarks” from the Indian government.
Saudi Arabia and Iran also submitted complaints with India, while the Jeddha-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation stated the statements came in a “context of intensifying hatred and abuse toward Islam in India and systematic practices against Muslims.”
Pakistan, for its part, summoned an Indian envoy on Monday to express Islamabad’s “strong condemnation.” This came a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif claimed the BJP officials’ remarks were “hurtful” and that “India under [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi is trampling religious liberties and harassing Muslims.”
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said in a statement: “These insults come in the context of the increasing intensity in hatred of and insults to Islam in India and the systematic harassment of Muslims.” 
So far, New Delhi has made no comment on the Arab states’ objections, but the Indian Foreign Ministry on Monday dismissed the OIC’s views as “unwarranted” and “narrow-minded.”
The Indian embassies in Qatar and Doha issued a statement on Sunday, saying that harsh measures had already been taken against individuals who made the disparaging remarks against Islam. Both declarations notably insisted that the sentiments voiced against the Prophet Muhammad and Islam were not those of the Indian government and were expressed by “fringe elements.”

20,"Ceuta-Melilla: Spain, Morocco To Discuss Full Reopening of Borders",Morocco and Spain agreed to open their borders immediately after King Mohammed VI and the Spanish PM met in April.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 06, 2022 2:59 p.m.","Rabat - Spain and Morocco will meet on Tuesday to discuss the complete reopening of the Moroccan borders with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.
Inter-ministerial delegations from the two countries will meet to discuss the schedule for completing the process of “normalizing the movement of people and goods,” Spanish news outlet El Pais quoted sources from the Spanish government as saying.
The meeting is in line with the joint declaration Madrid and Rabat issued following the visit of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Morocco.
During his Moroccan visit, the Spanish PM met with King Mohammed VI as part of the two countries' newfound determination to open a new phase of cooperation to end a year-long diplomatic crisis.
Under the joint declaration, Morocco and Spain agreed to open their borders immediately after the meeting between the King of Morocco and Sanchez.
While Moroccan borders with the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla reopened on May 17,  the reopening is taking place gradually.
For now, however, only Spanish citizens and foreigners with a residence permit and a Schengen visa are allowed to access or leave the enclaves.
On May 31, the passage was reopened for cross-border workers in Morocco. 
But “almost none [of the workers] were able to go to the Spanish enclaves, since they lacked a visa,” according to El Pais.

Official sources quoted by the Spanish news outlet  did not, however, clarify “whether the schedule to be agreed upon” will include the reopening of the commercial customs office in Melilla or the opening of a commercial customs office in Ceuta that “has never existed until now.”
Moroccan cross-border workers have been protesting near the borders with the Spanish enclaves, asking for the reopening of crossing points that have been closed for over two years due to COVID-19.
In addition to the outbreak of the pandemic, the smuggling of counterfeit goods into Morocco from Ceuta and Melilla is another reason why the North African country decided to close its borders with the two enclaves.
Despite the reopening of borders, the Moroccan government has maintained that the resumption of movement between Morocco and the two enclaves will not reverse its stance on stamping out the smuggling of counterfeits.

21,UN To Cut Food Rations to Sahrawis in Tindouf by 50%,A UN World Food Program official says the decision is due to the notable increase in grain prices amid the Ukraine-Russia conflict.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 06, 2022 2:24 p.m.","Rabat - The UN is planning to cut by 50% food rations directed to Sahrawis living in the Polisario-run camps in Tindouf, the westernmost province in Algeria.
Citing the UN World Food Program, the Spanish news outlet EFE reported that the decision to cut food rations directed to Sahrawis is due to “higher grain prices and freight rates.”
EFE’s report quoted a spokesperson for the UN World Food Program as saying that acute hunger is projected to increase by 47 million people if the conflict in Ukraine does not end.
“This represents an increase of 17 percent, being the most pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa,” the spokesperson said, adding that the cutting of food rations will also impact countries in the Sahel region.
The news is set to compound the Tindouf camps’ long-running malnutrition crisis,  with recent reports by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, having repeatedly outlined the prevalence of acute hunger in the Polisario-run camps.
In his October 2021 report, Guterres expressed concerns about hunger and malnutrition in Tindouf.
Over the years, UN-affiliated organizations have struggled to meet the needs of refugees and improve food security and nutrition in the Tindouf camps.

The UNHCR, UNICEF, and WFP received only 58% of their combined resource needs for their regular programs in 2020.
Several reports have linked malnutrition in the region to the embezzlement of humanitarian aid -- including food packages and funds -- meant for distressed refugees by the Polisario leadership.
In a revealing report in October 2021, the Tindouf-based Autonomy Support Forum (FORSATIN) considered Polisario’s mismanagement and misappropriation of humanitarian aid as the main factor behind the severe health crisis in the camps.
The “smuggling” of medical equipment and food supplies meant for refugees has long caused acute malnutrition and other health concerns in the Polisario-controlled, FORSATIN documented.
“As soon as they [aid packages] arrive and are pictured, these devices evaporate as if they never existed,” noted the report, adding that the shortage of medicines has been one of the camps’ festering issues despite yearly supplies from UN agencies and other relief NGOs.
Even pro-Polisario websites like Futuro Sahara have on occasion reported on the chronic embezzlement of humanitarian aid meant for Sahrawi refugees.
In 2018, Futuro Sahara revealed that food packs and other relief items sent to the Polisario-run camps mostly end up in Algerian grocery stores.
In an even more damning report in 2015, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) exposed a scandal about the selling and the embezzlement of international aid intended for Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. 
Covering the 2003-2007 period, the report documented how, amid widespread cases of malnutrition, poor health, and a large shortage of foodstuffs in the Tindouf camps, senior Polisario officials chose instead to sell EU relief products in Mauritanian and Sub-Saharan markets.

22,King Mohammed VI Departs on Private Trip to France,"The king of Morocco is expected to stay at his palace in Betz, a small town located 40 kilometers from Paris.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 03, 2022 11:03 a.m.","Rabat - King Mohammed VI is reportedly visiting France on a private trip, sources told news outlet Jeune Afrique.
The Moroccan monarch flew to France on Wednesday, June 1, the news outlet quoted a source close to the royal palace as saying.
The visit would be the first of its kind for the king of Morocco since the outbreak of COVID-19 and its induced traveling restrictions.
Amid the king’s visit to France, Jeune Afrique indicated that the two countries' relations suffered ups and downs since the election of Emmanuel Macron in 2017.
The news outlet referred to the French decision to reduce the number of visas issued to people from North Africa, including Morocco.
Morocco described France’s decision to limit the number of visas issued to Moroccans as “unjustified.”
Jeune Afrique suggested that King Mohammed VI is staying in his palace in Betz. Several reports shed light on the castle, often described as King Mohammed VI’s vacation palace.
In 2017, French television news outlet France 3 published a report dubbed “The King of Morocco and Betz, a story of generosity.”
During the report, France 3 emphasized the positive impact of King Mohammed VI’s visits to  Betz, a small village located 40 kilometers from Paris.
 “The King’s arrival cannot go unnoticed during his visits to the area because of the important security measures put in place during his stay in the small village,” explains France 3.
The report said that when the king of Morocco visited the region, he “brings with his employment.”
The report cited statements from locals, including grocery managers in the town.
Angelique Vetu, the manager of a small grocery shop in Betz, told France 3 that “[the King’s] priority is to make people work here in all sectors.” She added that many people see the King’s stay in the castle of Betz as a sign of generosity.

23,Spain Will Not Participate in 2022 African Lion Military Exercises,Spain was similarly absent from the 2021 military maneuvers amid diplomatic tensions between Rabat and Madrid.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 03, 2022 10:44 a.m.","Rabat - The 2022 African Lion, one of the largest and key military exercises in Africa, will mark the absence of Spain’s troops for the second year in a row.
Spanish news outlet EFE quoted military and diplomatic sources, suggesting that the Spanish military will not take part in the maneuver. The sources did not, however, unveil the reasons behind Spain’s alleged absence from the 2022 African Lion exercise.
More than 7,000 US troops will participate in the military training along with military forces from Morocco in addition to several countries.
The vast military exercises will take place in different places in Morocco, including Tan Tan, Mehbes, Taroudant, Ben Guerir near Marrakech, and Kenitra near Rabat.
Part of the military exercises will also take place in Tunisia, Senegal, and Ghana.
In 2021, Spain was also absent from the 2021 African Lion exercise amid unprecedented tension with Morocco.
In May 2021, Spanish news outlet El Pais said that Spain refused to participate in military exercises.
The Spanish media emphasized that the European country declined the US invitation, citing budgetary reasons.
El Pais quoted Spanish sources, claiming that the declined invitation was because “part of these exercises, in which Spain has participated every year, will be held for the first time in Western Sahara.”
In 2021, Spain prompted Moroccan backlash after hosting Polisario leader Brahim Ghali, who traveled to the European country using a fake passport and identity under the name of Mohamed Ben Battouch.
The visit to Spain was for hospitalization purposes. Yet Spain’s decision, and the failure to inform its southern neighbor of the decision, angered Morocco, which described the move from its European ally as against the spirit of partnership.
Morocco then recalled its ambassador to Madrid.
Following months of dialogue and Spanish attempts to mend ties, Morocco agreed to open a new phase of diplomatic relations with the European country.
This new phase followed Spain’s decision to officially endorse Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara.

The march, which was widely condemned by Palestinians, was littered with Islamophobic and anti-Arab chants. 
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohamed Shtayyeh concluded that the march itself was “aggression which crossed all red lines.” Condemnation also came from pro-Israeli figures. Hannah Weisfeld, Director of Yashad, felt “ashamed” watching footage of the chants during the march, calling it “extreme racism.”
The flag march is conducted annually to celebrate the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem in 1967 and its subsequent occupation. Thousands of Israeli nationalists gathered for the march,  bearing Israeli flags and marching through the Old City, including into the Muslim Quarter.
Unsurprisingly, the occasion resulted in clashes between Palestinians opposing the march and Israeli police. 79 Palestinians were injured with rubber bullets in Jerusalem, with a further 163 injured across the West Bank. 12 of these injuries were caused by live ammunition, and Israel says that five officers were also lightly injured.
The chants made by Israelis during the march included “Death to Arabs,” “May your village burn,” and “Mohammed is dead.” The anti-Arab and Islamophobic tone of the march was reported by some media, yet the BBC received criticism for its failure to include the blatant racism and Islamophobia in an article covering the march.
Chris Doyle, Director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, asked “If chants were “Death to Jews” and “A good Jew is a dead Jew”, who thinks the BBC ""would ignore…This is not journalism it is propaganda.” The BBC later reviewed the article on the flag march, mentioning the racist chanting in the ninth paragraph.
The march is the latest development in recent Israeli escalation of conflict in the region. Israeli soldiers locked Palestinians in the Al Aqsa mosque on May 29 as Jewish tours made their way through the neighborhood. 
Palestinians were also assaulted by police at the funeral of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Mourners were attacked with stun grenades and beaten with battens as they carried the coffin of Abu Akleh through the Old City on May 13.

25,"Survey: Despite Ukraine War, 37% of Moroccans Want To Keep Ties With Russia","While the majority of Moroccans hold positive views of the EU and the US, many are against the cutting of economic ties with Russia.",Souad Anouar,"May 31, 2022 1:59 p.m.","Rabat - 37% of Moroccans are in favor of keeping economic ties with Russia while only 14% want to cut ties with the country, the latest Democracy Perception Index reported on Monday.
Of the 758 Moroccans surveyed for “the world’s largest annual study on democracy,” the report found that 30% held positive views about Russia, marking a close tie with the other 26% that had a negative perception of the European country. 
Released amid the war in Ukraine, the Democracy Perception Index focused this year on the global opinion about the ongoing war as well as the general perception of the US, EU, China, Russia, and NATO amid global crises that are considered to impact the general decline in democracy around the world. 
Since the Russian attack on Ukraine in late February, a united Western front has taken measures over the past months to cripple the Russian economy and help Ukraine in its efforts to fend off Russian troops. Still, 46% of the total respondents said that the European Union, the United States, and NATO are doing “too little” to assist Ukraine. 
Surveying over 50,000 individuals from 53 countries, the poll showed a global tendency in favorable public opinion for the US and EU compared to a “far more negative than positive” perception of Russia and its ally China which is raising concerns about the potential invasion of Taiwan. 
The majority of respondents in 31 out of 52 countries were in favor of cutting economic ties with Russia, with many calling for putting more pressure on the country to end its war on Ukraine. 
Moroccan stance on the war in Ukraine
Since Morocco belongs to the remaining 21 countries that want to maintain relations with Russia, the North African country might be misunderstood as holding positive perceptions of Russia not only as a country and a partner but also an “invader” of Ukraine. This stance is reflected in the Guardian’s coverage of the index. 
“Negative views of Russia are largely confined to Europe and other liberal democracies. Positive views of Russia have been retained in China, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, Algeria, Morocco, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia,” the British newspaper wrote on Monday. 
The Guardian’s wording and choice of Morocco over Moroccans presents the opinion of less than 800 individuals as the official stance of the country. Throughout the Ukraine war, the Moroccan government has repeatedly called for peaceful negotiation and immediate de-escalation of the crisis.

Morocco's sense of “neutrality” in this war reflects the country’s adoption of a non-aligned stance despite rising European condemnation and sanctions against Russia. As some observers have documented, this choice of neutrality is part of a global trend - led by China - of third-world countries navigating their national interests in the face of a new iteration of the Cold War. 
Wanting to keep good diplomatic and economic relations with Ukraine and Russia, Morocco appears to be prioritizing its own interests - food security and stability -  while calling for an end to a war that has caused untold devastation in Ukraine and has heavily impacted the global markets of wheat, oil, gas, gold, and semiconductors.

Intentionally or not, the Guardian’s report portrays Morocco as a supporter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A war that is considered a major threat to democracy and freedom that “we can no longer take for granted,” said Nico Jaspers, CEO of Latana, co-creator of the index. 
The British newspaper’s framing also ignores other statistics mentioned in the same index that confirm Moroccans’ favorable perception of the US and the EU. In particular, the index indicated that 41% of Moroccan interviewees called on the US, EU, and NATO to provide more support to Ukraine, arguing that the assistance the war-stricken country has so far received is “too little.”
Moroccan democracy
Besides sharing opinions about Russia and the West, the surveyed Moroccans stressed the importance of democracy (82%), freedom of speech (59%), and the positive role of social media in promoting democracy in their country (68%). 
They further called the Moroccan government to prioritize education and health care as well as fight poverty and corruption. 
Despite the government's efforts to address climate change and promote gender equality, the surveyed Moroccans paid little importance to the two issues as they placed them at the bottom of requested government priorities. 
More than 40% of the surveyed Moroccans considered poverty and hunger as the top global challenges, ahead of war, violent conflict, and global pandemics.

26,Pegasus: Samir Bennis Slams Spanish Media for Anti-Moroccan Biases,"With new evidence now exonerating Morocco of spying charges in Spain, the Spanish media has failed to correct its anti-Moroccan rhetoric.",Oussama Aamari,"May 30, 2022 6:55 p.m.","Rabat - Having previously accused Morocco of using the Pegasus spyware to spy on Spanish politicians, the Spanish media is coming under fire for its failure to correct its reporting after it came out that the spying was actually done by the Spanish government.
The Guardian reported on May 3 that the mobile phones of several Spanish politicians and public figures had been infected with spyware “by an NSO Group client believed to be Morocco.”
Following the report, there was an avalanche of similar unevidenced accusations in the Spanish media. As they again fixated on calling out Morocco, the Spanish coverage of the spying allegations cited no evidence other than the similar accusations by the Guardian.
In fact, some went as far as to suggest that the recent improvement in Morocco-Spain diplomatic relations, especially Madrid’s endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara, was due to Morocco having some sort of blackmail on the Spanish government.
Experts had called for independent investigations into the matter as the news of the spying scandal broke.
“We are absolutely certain that it was an external attack … because in Spain, in a democracy like ours, all such interventions are carried out by official bodies and with judicial authorisation,” the Minister of the Presidency Felix Bolanos said at the time.
Earlier this week, however, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez spoke to Spain’s Congress about the use of the spyware by Spanish intelligence services to spy on politicians and Catalonian separatists.
While Sanchez claimed to have been unaware of the espionage by the Spanish intelligence, he did not disapprove of it, saying that riots in Catalonia posed a threat to national security justifying the espionage.
Despite the emergence of the new details about the government itself being behind the spying, Spanish media outlets have failed to correct their Morocco-blaming narrative.

Political analyst Samir Bennis said on Twitter that those journalists who are always quick to blame Morocco should “admit their mea culpa” and confess to having made a mistake by blaming Morocco.
“As soon as the news came out almost a month ago about an alleged espionage case through the Israeli program Pegasus, many Spanish journalists rushed to accuse Morocco without having the slightest proof that the country was behind it,” Bennis noted in a Twitter thread.
“And now news has come out about the existence of a large-scale espionage program by the Spanish government, no one dares to say that the accusations against Morocco were unjust and gratuitous,” he went on to say. “They have turned the page as if nothing happened at all.”
He also commented on how the scandal will affect Sanchez’s government’s chances at the next election and exacerbate tensions in an already tense political atmosphere in the country.
“There was a deliberate attempt by the Spanish [media], perhaps with the collusion of some members of the government - to suggest that Morocco was behind the attack, thus taking heat off the Spanish government and deviating the attention of the public opinion from large-scale spying scandal against Spanish politicians,” Bennis pointed out.
As it turned out, however, he added, “the Spanish government undertook the spying operation without seeking judicial authorization from the competent authorities.”
According to Bennis, reinforcing the notion of the Spanish media’s anti-Morocco bias is “that there have been voices inside the Spanish government itself that raised their concern about the fact that the Centro National de Inteligencia, Spanish intelligence services are very secretive and escape the control of the government.” 
This, he argued, begs the question of whether Spanish intelligence services have made the decision to spy not only on the Catalan independentists but also on some members of the government. 
Accusations of the use of the spyware go back to last year, after reports from Amnesty International and Forbidden Stories asserted the usage of the software by Morocco and other nations to spy on political rivals.
Morocco had answered by filing defamation lawsuits in Spain, asserting that it does not own or use the software.
Amnesty, the organization that originally accused Morocco, also condemned the espionage by Spain’s government, saying that intelligence services acted “with total impunity.”

27,Israeli FM: Israel Wants to Normalize Relations With Saudi Arabia,"Israel sees the Gulf kingdom as an invaluable partner to have in the Arab, Muslim world.",Lamine Rahhali,"May 30, 2022 4:42 p.m.","Rabat - Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said today that Israel has been in discussions with the US and Gulf Arab countries to explore the normalization of diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia.
Making the comments in an interview with Israel’s Army Radio, Lapid appeared optimistic about the prospects of normalization with Riyadh. He conceded, however, that any progress in the matter will be slow.
Lapid’s statement comes days after reports that the Biden administration is pushing to mediate a territorial deal that involves Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.
Experts say that Biden’s upcoming June visit to the Middle East is aimed at bringing about a marked shift in the diplomatic makeup of the MENA region.
However, Saudi Arabia has continuously stated that it will not normalize relations with Israel until a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian cause is reached.
Speaking last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud was adamant that normalization with Israel ""cannot happen"" until there is a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian issue.
The chief Saudi diplomat sought to reiterate that, despite reports of imminent normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, his country is still a long way from joining the group of Arab countries that have signed the 2020, US-brokered Abraham Accords.

On the Israeli side, meanwhile, Lapid’s comments constitute yet the latest indication of a burning desire to normalize relations with a kingdom many senior Israeli commentators and officials consider as an influential voice in MENA affairs.
Just yesterday, Egypt and Israel signed a deal aimed at boosting bilateral trade and strategic economic cooperation. With the deal coinciding with reports of behind-the-scenes and US-mediated efforts to facilitate diplomatic rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, some have said the deal might be aimed at giving Cairo further incentive to hasten the process of giving the strategic islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia.
From Israel’s perspective, normalization with Saudi Arabia will allow the Jewish state to have open ties with an invaluable ally in the Arab, Muslim world and the largest economy in the Persian Gulf.
With the Biden administration having made plain its goal of mediating normalization deals between Tel Aviv and Riyadh, it remains to be seen whether Saudi Arabia will also eventually agree to normalizing ties with the Jewish state.

28,David Govrin: Morocco Can Mediate Between Israel and Hamas,"Despite resuming diplomatic relations with Israel in late 2020, Morocco supports Palestine and has maintained friendly ties with Hamas.",Oussama Aamari,"May 29, 2022 3:58 p.m.","Rabat - Israel’s envoy to Morocco, David Govrin, has said he hopes that Morocco can play the role of mediator between Israel and Hamas.
Speaking to the American news agency The Media Line on Friday during a conference in Casablanca, Govrin said Morocco could play “a very significant role” in mediation efforts, adding that the country used to play that role in the 80s and 90s.
“We believe Morocco can play this role once again, as it enjoys very good relations with Israel and with other Arab countries,” Govrin elaborated.
In addition, the Israeli diplomat was also asked about the recent tensions between Israel and Palestine, and whether those can undermine the developing relations with Rabat.
The two countries’ “binational relations are based not only on interests. They are based on common culture and shared values,” Govrin responded, adding that the Jewish community in Morocco and their historical heritage continues to play a considerable role in warming diplomatic ties.
Morocco recently condemned Israeli violations in Al-Aqsa Mosque during the month of Ramadan, calling for international action against what Rabat characterized as a systematic violation of Palestinians’ rights.
Tensions with Palestine were only made worse following Israel’s shooting of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, sparking protests in Morocco and across the globe.
On the subject of the Western Sahara dispute, Govrin declined to make substantive comments on Israel’s position but insisted the leaders of Morocco and Israel would discuss the topic “sooner rather than later.”
Govrin attended the Start-Up Nation Central conference in Casablanca, which saw the signing of various agreements between Morocco and Israel for more cooperation in the private sector.

Notably, the two countries will be collaborating in the technology sector, with a focus on agricultural technologies, military tech, artificial intelligence, and more.
The deepening of cooperation with Moroccan companies and the hiring of Moroccan engineers and programmers were among the main talking points for Israeli businessmen at the Start-Up Nation Central conference. 
Echoing earlier comments by several other Israeli officials, Govrin spoke emphatically of Israel’s readiness to collaborate further with Morocco in a broad range of fields. Morocco resumed diplomatic ties with Israel in late 2020, as part of a series of peace agreements between Israel and different countries in the Middle East. But the North African country continues to support “the just Palestinian cause” and has also maintained friendly ties with Hamas.

29,Israel Could Transfer Egyptian Territories to Saudi Arabia to Normalize Ties,"The US is allegedly brokering the deal between Riyad, Caro, and Tel Aviv to transfer the disputed territories back to Saudi Arabia.",Jihane Rahhou,"May 29, 2022 2:42 p.m.","Rabat - Israel is considering handing over two disputed territories currently under Egyptian sovereignty to Saudi Arabia, paving the way for normalizing ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported today citing unnamed official sources.
The two territories in question are Tiran and Sanafir, two strategically located islands in the Red Sea. While the islands fall officially under Egyptian jurisdiction, transferring them to the sovereignty of another country requires the permission of Israel.
According to Saudi and Egyptian officials, Saudi Arabia originally gave the territories over to Egypt in 1950.
However, following the Arab-Iraeli war of October 1973, Egypt and Israel signed a treaty whereby Tiran and Sanafir became fully demilitarized and was placed under the observation of a multinational task force spearheaded by the US.
Egypt had previously approved transferring the two territories back to Riyadh in 2018, but the decision caused widespread public protests in the country. 
As the decision necessitates the approval of Israel under the 1976 treaty, the transfer remained pending for four years, allowing the US-led observation team to continue its mission and allowing maritime freedom to ships heading for Israel’s Eilat Port.
Haaretz’ report indicates that the Biden administration is brokering a new round of negotiations between Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel to transfer the two territories.
The Israeli newspaper quoted its sources as saying that negotiations are still ongoing and that the current White House administration aims to seal the deal before Biden’s upcoming trip to the Middle East in late June. 
Despite not officially normalizing ties, Israel and Saudi Arabia have been engaging in behind-the-scenes negotiations on defense and other “strategic” issues.

Palestine news agency WAFA reported that Israeli police escorted a group of settlers, who performed rituals across the compound in a further escalatory move.
“The provocative tours are still going on until this moment,” the news agency said.
The Israeli settlers’ tour came ahead of the contested flag-waving march that is scheduled to take place later today.
The march is expected to draw further tension in the region, which has been witnessing several clashes due to Israeli violations and attacks against Palestinians.
According to WAFA, Israeli police officers “brutally assaulted” an elderly Palestinian man earlier today during the settlers’ tour.
Israeli police also arrested four Palestinians at the Chain Gate, one of the gates leading to the Al Aqsa compound.
“Israeli police also imposed strict restrictions on the entry of Palestinians to the compound, only allowing people above the age of 40 access to the compound,” WAFA added.
The Palestinian Foreign Affairs Ministry released a communique today, stating that “by allowing hunters of Israeli fanatics into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound this morning, the Israeli government was aligning itself with racist elements that are fanning the flames of religious tensions in Jerusalem.”
The ministry condemned Sunday’s raids, saying that Palestine holds the Israeli government responsible for the provocative parade.
“As an occupying power, Israel is restricted by international law to acting only as the temporary administrator of the Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem,” said the ministry’s statement.
Palestinians need protection against Israeli settlers’ unrelentingly hostile agenda, the Palestinian authority said, calling for an “immediate” international, UN-led intervention to address Israeli provocation and attacks on Palestinians. e Israeli hostile agenda.

In comments made during her meeting with Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita, Rouamba stressed that the kingdom's autonomy plan ""represents the only credible and realistic solution"" to the Western Sahara dispute.
As well as describing the Moroccan autonomy plan as ""a credible as serious solution for the Western Sahara dispute,"" the head of Burkinabe diplomacy hailed the UN's efforts for reaching a realistic, practical, and lasting solution to the long-standing territorial dispute.
Invoking recent recommendations by the UN Security Council and the decision of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the African Union held in July 2018, Rouamba argued that any solution to the Western Sahara question must preserve the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Morocco.
Meanwhile, Bourita welcomed Burkina Faso's participation in the ministerial conference in support of Morocco's autonomy initiative held virtually in January 2021 alongside the US.
The Moroccan minister recalled the opening of Burkina Faso's Consulate General in Dakhla in October 2020, notably expressing Rabat’s readiness to further strengthen cooperation with Ouagadougou.
Earlier this year, Morocco and Burkina Faso renewed their commitment to developing multi-dimensional cooperation at the bilateral, regional, and international levels. 
The two countries also agreed to extend their cooperation to fight against terrorism and radicalism and the implementation of economic, technical-scientific, and cultural projects for the benefit of their respective people.
The value of Moroccan exports to Burkina Faso reached $83.7 million in 2019. According to OEC data, the exports included refined petroleum ($27.3 million), insulated wire ($7.81 million), and mineral or chemical fertilizers ($5.89 million).

32,Morocco Renews Commitment to Fight Humanitarian Crisis in Africa,Moroccan FM and his counterparts from various African countries pledge to reinforce security cooperation across the continent.,Oumaima Latrech,"May 28, 2022 3:35 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco reaffirmed this week its continuous commitment to  combat terrorism and other emerging threats across Africa during the two African Union Extraordinary Humanitarian Summits in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.
Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita held a series of talks with a number of his African counterparts within the framework of the AU summits.
Bourita also met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Head of Cameroonian Diplomacy, as well as with the President of the Libyan Presidential Council Mohamed Younes Al-Manfi.
The meetings focused on the need of consolidating bilateral relations in various fields of cooperation.
Representing King Mohammed VI at the two extraordinary AU Summits held between May 25 to 28, Bourita reiterated the Moroccan monarch’s vision for a united African response to the emerging humanitarian challenges.
The Extraordinary Summits come at a time when the African continent is facing several challenges, such  internal armed conflicts, health and food insecurity, and climate breakdown.
The situation was further exacerbated by the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian crisis.
During this week’s AU summits, Bourita highlighted King Mohammed VI’s humanitarian commitment to the African continent, stressing that Morocco’s engagement “is based on an approach that integrates the multiple security, humanitarian, and ecological challenges facing Africa.”

As Africa navigated the first, panic-stricken months of the pandemic, Bourita recalled, King Mohammed VI contributed to the continental management of the COVID-19 crisis by sending  medical aid to 20 African countries.
Africa is projected to face more humanitarian crises in the coming years if African nations do not work out a collective response to climate-induced challenges and other pressing continental concerns across the continent, Bourita warned.  The continent is “facing an emergency,” he commented, noting that there are nearly 36 million individuals who are internally displaced (IDPs), refugees, and asylum seekers across Africa.
“Of the nearly 60 million IDPs worldwide in 2021, more than 80% are in sub-Saharan Africa,” Bourita said, adding that “Africa will have some 86 million climate-displaced people by 2050.”
Food insecurity is also a major challenge in the continent. More than 282 million people are currently undernourished in Africa, and the Sahel alone is home to 18 million people who are at risk of hunger in the coming months, including 7.7 million children under the age of 5, detailed the chief Moroccan diplomat.
Bourita also mentioned the ruinous impact of political instability and armed conflicts on Africa’s development prospects, saying that the apparent return of military coups in Africa could mark an unfortunate “regression” in the continent’s democratic process.
As African countries brace themselves for the inescapable challenges ahead, he concluded, Morocco is more than ever ready to share its expertise in numerous sectors and assist its fellow African nations in tackling challenges such as food insecurity.

The presidential decree detailing the diplomatic transfers said that Belyaev was “dismissed” from his post, and that Shuvaev has been “freed” from his work in Rabat to replace him.
The decision comes as the country is still grappling with western sanctions and trying to garner some level of international support amid its war in Ukraine.
Observers have noted the decision comes a few days after Belyaev commented to Algerian press saying that Moscow and Algiers are in constant “consultation” over the Western Sahara dispute.
With Morocco having maintained a relatively neutral position on the Moscow-Kyiv conflict, the development would suggest that Russia would like to keep diplomatic relations with Morocco and other nations good to keep precious international support.
Russia also announced on Friday that it has appointed Vladimir Baibakov to replace Shuvaev as ambassador to Rabat.
Baibakov led a prolific diplomatic career for Moscow before this most recent assignment.
He notably worked as a senior counselor in Russia’s embassy to the United States, as well as the Director of the Department of the Middle East and North Africa in Russia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry. Baibakov also served as Chief Diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Mauritania.

“I would sincerely like to salute the contribution of the Moroccan expedition to the United Nations [Peacekeeping] Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo,” said Jean-Tobie Okala in a UN video broadcast to celebrate the International Day of UN Peacekeepers.
The World's Blue Helmet Day, which is on May 29, was established by the UN General Assembly in December 2002, to honor the sacrifices and valuable contributions of civilian, police, and military personnel that take part in UN peacekeeping efforts.
Okala said that the Moroccan peacekeeping mission has been carrying out initiatives to support the local population for several years, particularly in terms of health services. Morocco in 2003 established a “level 2” hospital in the Ituri region.
According to Military Medicine, level 2 hospitals provide advanced life support, basic surgery, intensive care units, and limited patient holding capacity to peacekeepers within a mission area. The level 2 hospital is backed up by auxiliary laboratory and radiology facilities, a dental unit, and hospital support personnel.
Morocco was named the first global contributor to international peace and security in April by the Good Country Index (GCI), based on the country's contributions to peacekeeping operations and the UN peacekeeping budget, as well as its efforts to address cybersecurity and refrain from exporting weapons.

Morocco currently has over 1,700 soldiers and police deployed to UN peacekeeping missions in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, and South Sudan.
According to Morocco's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, more than 74,000 Moroccan peacekeepers have served in 14 UN peacekeeping missions since Morocco first joined the corps in 1960.

Gonzalez had been facing a lawsuit after she decided to allow Polisario leader Ghali access to Spanish territory for hospitalization in April 2021. 
“There is no indication to support the conclusion that [the former FM] was aware of the existence of a legal interest in this person,” the court said.
Gonzalez welcomed the court’s decision in an interview with Cadena Ser, saying she “would welcome back” Ghali, if “necessary for humanitarian reasons.”
The court’s decision came despite reports and complaints, linking Ghali and the Polisario Front with several serious charges, including war crimes, rape, assaults, detention, among other forms of crimes.
The Canarian Association of Victims of Terrorism (ACAVITE), repeatedly condemned the separatist group’s  documented killings of hundreds of Spaniards during terror attacks against Spanish fishing vessels in the southern provinces of Morocco in the 1970s and 1980s
Sahrawi refugee and activist Khadijatou Mahmoud continues to seek justice against Ghali, who she accuses of rape and sexual assault
In a recent interview earlier this year,  the Sahrawi activist who lives in Spain condemned the lack of actions from Spain’s judiciary. The activist accused Ghali of raping her in 2010 at the “embassy” of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in Algiers, where he served as an “ambassador.”
Several other people resubmitted their lawsuit to Spain’s judiciary to seek justice following Ghali’s admission into Spain.
Amid ongoing lawsuits and severe backlash from Morocco, Spain allowed Ghali to leave Spain in June 2021. 
Ghali’s entry to Spanish territory resulted in a deep diplomatic feud between Morocco and Spain.
The diplomatic crisis lasted until March 2022, when Spain and Morocco announced the restoration of diplomatic relations after Pedro Sanchez’s government endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara.

Baipo-Temon welcomed the North African kingdom’s continuous efforts to reach a political, realistic, practical, and lasting solution to the Western Sahara dispute within the framework of the UN.
Speaking on Wednesday at a joint press briefing with Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita, Baipo-Temon said that the Central African country “supports Morocco’s autonomy plan as the one and only solution within the framework of its territorial integrity.”
The minister also said that her talks with Bourita, held on the sidelines of the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition against Daesh, was an opportunity to discuss strengthening bilateral ties.
Around 80 countries are attending the high-level Marrakech meeting to review the actions world governments have taken in the past years to tackle global terrorism and other emerging security challenges. 
Amid alarming reports of increasing insecurity in the already fragile and politically unstable Sahel region, the Coalition announced the creation of the Africa Focus Group a few months before the ministerial meeting
Morocco and the CAR also highlighted a number of issues of common interests, pledging to contribute to ensuring security and safety in the region.
The Central African minister stressed the importance of international commitment to combat terrorism on the African continent, commending King Mohammed VI’s efforts in promoting the development of the continent while taking the lead on questions relating to the fight against terrorism and extremism.
In terms of bilateral ties, Morocco and the CAR have long been cooperating to fight against terrorist groups to promote stability throughout Africa.
CAR has lauded on several occasions Morocco’s commitment to the UN Security Council’s resolutions on the Sahara question, expressing its unwavering support for a long-lasting UN decision.
In January 2020, the CAR opened a general consulate in Morocco’s southern city of Laayoune, acting its recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over the southern provinces.
Morocco’s Autonomy Plan has garnered widespread internal support since the US officially endorsed the plan and recognized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in December 2020.
France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have all endorsed the Moroccan autonomy initiative in recent months, while more than twenty African and Arab countries have cemented their support of Morocco’s territorial integrity by opening diplomatic representations in the cities of Dakhla and Laayoune.

37,Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara Enjoys International Support,Morocco’s stance on Western Sahara continues to attract international support after the US and Spain's official endorsements.,Souad Anouar,"May 12, 2022 12:36 p.m.","Rabat - Several foreign ministers have stressed their countries’ support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara, underlining its credibility and potential to resolve the lingering territorial dispute in line with the UN resolutions on the matter. 
On Wednesday, Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita held numerous bilateral meetings with his Romanian, Serbian, Cypriot, and Nigerien counterparts. The meetings were held on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the Global Coalition against Daesh.
Bogdan Aurescu, Romania’s foreign minister, commended Morocco’s serious efforts to establish “a just, lasting and mutually acceptable” solution to the Western Sahara dispute, recalling the North African kingdom’s submission of the Autonomy Plan proposal to the UN Security Council in 2007. 
Bourita and Aurescu stressed their countries’ role in promoting and preserving peace and stability in Africa, the Mediterranean, as well as Central Europe and the Balkans. 
They further called for the consolidation of political dialogue and cooperation between the two countries in education, vocational training, scientific research, and digitization to advance the 60-year-old diplomatic relations between Bucharest and Rabat. 
Nikola Selakovic, Serbia’s Foreign Minister, echoed Aurescu’s statements, adding that his country supports the “serious and credible” Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara which underpins the Kingdom’s sovereignty over the disputed territory.

Discussion over territorial integrity between Bourita and Selakovic also extended to the dispute between Serbia on one side and Kosovo and Metohija on another. 
Selakovic additionally praised Morocco’s commitment to sustainable socio-economic growth as well as African stability and development. 
Territorial integrity was also at the center of the bilateral meeting between Bourita and his Cypriot counterpart Ioannis Kasoulides who reaffirmed his country’s support of Morocco’s autonomy proposal.  
“We will work together today to establish a roadmap for bilateral cooperation in all areas,” Kasoulides said. The roadmap would provide a basis for the deepening of political, economic, and cultural ties between Nicosia and Rabat at the bilateral, regional, and international levels. 
For his part, Hassoumi Massaoudou, Niger’s Foreign Minister, said that ""Niger supports the position of the African Union, which consecrates the exclusivity of the United Nations as a framework for the search for a solution to the regional conflict created around the question of the Sahara."" 
Massaoudou further welcomed Morocco's efforts to resolve the long-standing dispute around the status of Western Sahara. 
Romania, Serbia, Cyprus, and Niger’s stances on Western Sahara demonstrate an international tendency to commend Morocco’s “credible and serious” autonomy proposal, particularly after the official endorsements of the United States and Spain. 
Earlier this week, Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey, Guinea, and Central Africa all stated their pro-Morocco stances on the dispute. 
Currently, more than 20 countries have diplomatic representations in the cities of Dakhla and Laayoune, cementing their support of the Moroccanness of Western Sahara.

Speaking on Wednesday during a joint conference with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita, the Turkish official reaffirmed Ankara’s long-standing position on Morocco’s sovereignty over its territories.
“I would like to reiterate Turkey's principled position in favor of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries, and reaffirm Turkey's support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of brotherly Morocco,” Cavusoglu said.
Cavusoglu stressed that during his meeting with Bourita, they discussed bilateral relations and ways to further increase cooperation, mainly in trade and regional issues such as the Libyan crisis.
The Bourita-Cavusoglu meeting was held on the sidelines of the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition against Daesh in Marrakech.
The high-level meeting was held this week for the first time in an African country, testifying to Moroco’s pursuit of international commitment to counter-terrorism and extremism while collaborating with other countries to face terrorist threats worldwide and in the MENA region.
The Turkish minister also said that the meeting, which brought together over 80 countries, comes at an “important time,” in light of the continuing emerging threat of terrorist organizations in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Sahel region in Africa.
“Peace, stability, and prosperity of the Sahel Region and North Africa are indispensable for the stability of the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, and even Europe,” he stressed.
Meanwhile, Moroccan FM Bourita said that the North African country “appreciates Turkey’s position on the Western Sahara dispute,” noting that the bilateral meeting was an opportunity to exchange on many international and regional issues, saying that Turkey is an “active actor in many international organizations.”
In terms of bilateral economic cooperation, he highlighted that Morocco and Turkey “agreed to create new opportunities for the private sector as well.”
Like Turkey, many countries that took part in the Global Coalition meeting in Marrakech reiterated their support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan and sovereignty over its southern territories.

39,Moroccan-Spanish Joint Declaration: A New Diplomatic Roadmap,"Thanks to the new joint declaration, Moroccan-Spanish relations are set to become stronger than ever.",Aya Benazizi,"May 11, 2022 4:36 p.m.","Casablanca - Morocco and Spain are set to enjoy a new phase of positive cooperation and stronger ties, according to both countries' foreign ministers. 
Following their long-awaited first bilateral meeting yesterday in Marrakech, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares, and his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita announced that the two countries have entered a new phase of diplomatic ties as a result of the joint declaration issued by the two nations.
The two countries released a joint statement following Spanish President Pedro Sanchez's recent visit to Morocco which resulted in yesterday's ministerial meeting. The statement aims to announce the start of a new chapter in bilateral ties. 
According to Bourita, this important meeting was “necessary to address the steps we have taken in implementing the road map” that was agreed upon during the visit of the Spanish Prime Minister to Morocco last April, at the invitation of King Mohammed VI.
“On the basis of this commitment, and in accordance with King Mohammed VI's clear instructions,” Bourita noted, during a press conference following the meeting, that “the Moroccan side is working toward the full implementation of all elements of the joint statement, including those related to the flexible movement of people and goods between the two countries.”
He further emphasized that Morocco will continue to implement the elements contained in the joint statement using the same logic of close dialogue in order to achieve the King's and the Spanish Prime Minister's vision of “a strong, renewed relationship and partnership in all fields.”
A win-win cooperation
The outcomes of bilateral collaboration are beginning to be realized on the ground, whether in the sector of migration, security, or economic cooperation. So far, Moroccan-Spanish cooperation has been exemplary and acknowledged at the regional, European, and global levels, Bourita said.
Since Morocco’s monarch held in-depth meetings with the Spanish Prime Minister, diplomats from both countries have been hard at work. Recent cooperation included discussing the transit procedure for Operation Marhaba 2022, reopening maritime links between the two countries, and the convening of Moroccan-Spanish working groups on migration.
Bourita added that the two parties are expected to meet for bilateral cooperation on culture and educational scientific exchange, as well as two additional teams for marine boundary demarcation and airspace management, in addition to the bilateral visits.
Bourita assured the Spanish foreign minister that “Spain can count on Morocco as a reliable partner, honest and responsible partner to build an exemplary partnership between two neighboring countries that share multiple interests and a common history.” He added that Morocco desires to strengthen consultations with Spain on international, regional, and multilateral issues.
On the other hand, he highlighted Morocco's reliance on Spain as a partner and ally in its dealings with the European Union. Bourita noted that the Spanish-Moroccan relationship “is not against anyone, but rather to protect bilateral interests, develop partnership, and enhance security and stability.”
The Moroccan diplomat also expressed his country’s desire to cooperate with Spain on a framework for cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean area, as well as on regional and security challenges in the Sahel, North Africa, and the rest of the African continent.
Moroccan-Spanish economic outcomes
During his meeting with his Moroccan counterpart yesterday, Manuel Albares reaffirmed Spain's commitment to the objectives outlined in the joint statement issued at the end of the Spanish prime minister's visit to Morocco in April.
Following their meetings, Manuel Albares stated in a joint news conference with Bourita that the two nations are making steady efforts to advance their new agreement. He applauded the amount of investment between the two countries, highlighting that roughly 800 Spanish companies have been established in Morocco.
Thanks to these investments, he added, Morocco has become Spain's main market outside the European Union, while Spain remains Morocco's first customer and supplier.
Manuel Albares additionally praised the momentum in migration-related cooperation. He noted that the resumption of bilateral cooperation in this field contributed to a significant decrease in the flow of irregular migrants to the Canary Islands and the Iberian Peninsula, thanks to cooperation between security authorities in both countries.
The restoration of collaboration around Operation Marhaba, according to the Spanish minister, is another good example of the resuscitation of bilateral ties based on transparency and mutual respect.
Fighting against terrorism: Uniting Morocco and Spain
In addition to other critical international concerns, Morocco and Spain are on the same page when it comes to fighting extremism.
The Spanish minister used the press conference to reiterate his country's commitment to fighting terrorism with Morocco, emphasizing that cooperation between the two nations is the sole guarantee of the two peoples' security and prosperity.
He also highlighted his country's intention to expand this collaboration to regular cooperation in all bilateral domains.
Western Sahara: A fateful file between Morocco and Spain
Bourita stated Tuesday in Marrakesh that the Spanish government's backing for Morocco’s autonomy plan is part of global efforts to find a solution to the artificial dispute over the Western Sahara region, emphasizing that “the kingdom appreciates and values this new position.”
Bourita asserted that this position is entirely consistent with the Security Council's vision, aligns with international trends, and echoes the position of many European countries and the majority of Arab and African countries.
“Whoever wants this conflict to continue, with the instability it creates in the region and the suffering of detainees in the Tindouf camps, can continue to encourage the status quo,” Bourita told. This instability “has been going on for four decades and could be prolonged if there is no mobilization to settle this conflict, within the framework of the only possible solution,” Bourita stated as he referred to the Autonomy Initiative.
Bourita concluded that the joint statement issued last April has opened new horizons for bilateral relations. According to Bourita, the joint statement highlighted a series of initiatives and measures that should be taken to give bilateral ties a strong push.
The new chapter of relations between the two neighboring nations is “based on collaboration, coordination, ambition, and mutual respect,” underlined the Moroccan diplomat.

40,"Moroccan FM: Separatism Breeds Terrorism, Instability","The Moroccan FM has not directly referenced Algeria, but he previously made similar remarks denouncing the Algerian regime’s approach to financing and support for the Polisario Front.",Safaa Kasraoui,"May 11, 2022 4:06 p.m.","Rabat - Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita has denounced the financing, arming, and support of separatist groups, describing such acts as critical factors in spreading terrorism and instability across the world.  
Bourita made the remark during his opening speech at the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS that opened today in the city of Marrakech, with the participation of 80 countries.
The Moroccan FM recalled the world's efforts to tackle the scourge of terrorism but reminded attendees that terrorist challenges remain prevalent across the world.
He also spoke about how Africa has become a target for terrorist groups, particularly those affiliated with ISIS, in search of a new base.
After sharing concerns about ISIS threats, the Moroccan FM  spoke about the terrorism-separatism nexus, which he said is undermining the stability and sovereignty of many countries in Africa and beyond. 
“The convergence of financial, tactical, and operational means, creates an objective alliance between terrorist and separatist groups,” the Moroccan FM said, stressing the increasing number of individuals crossing from separatist to terror groups and “vice-versa.”
Polisario’s terrorist links
Bourita did not directly reference the case of the Polisario Front. However, several reports have in recent years pointed to the existence of “dangerous links” between the Polisario Front and terrorist groups in the Sahel and elsewhere.
In 2017, Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) said that about 100 members of Polisario had joined ISIS.
In 2021, France announced the death of Adnan Abu Walid Al Sahrawi, the leader of the terrorist group known as ISIS in the Greater Sahara.
Al Sahrawi was born in Laayoune and moved to Algeria, where he trained and fought with the Polisario Front’s armed units, before branching off to radical jihadist groups.
Polisario is a separatist group claiming independence for Western Sahara with the financial, political, and logistic backing of Algeria.
Bourita emphasized that separatism and terrorism are “very often two sides of the same coin.”
Anyone financing, sheltering, supporting, and weaponizing separatists are “contributing to spread terrorism and further compromise regional peace and security, ” Bourita said, adding that encouraging separatism is “tantamount to complicity with terrorism.”
The ministerial meeting in Marrakech served as an opportunity for the international community to show a common commitment to the rise of the challenges of the merging forms of global terrorism.
During the event, high-level officials also emphasized Morocco’s efforts to tackle terror threats at home and in the region.
Italian Foreign minister Luigi di Mai stressed the importance of Morocco’s role in contributing to security efforts in the Sahel, saying: “I would like to stress the importance of the role played by Morocco as a pole of democracy and regional stability in the Sahel and Mediterranean regions.”

41,"Morocco Renews Commitment to Counterterrorism, Strengthen Security",Morocco has increased its efforts in the last two decades to effectively ensure stability and security by tackling terrorism and violent extremism.,Oumaima Latrech,"May 11, 2022 3:26 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco has been keen to adopt an advanced criminal policy approach to counterterrorism since the 2003 terrorist attack in Casablanca, said the Moroccan Minister of Justice Abdellatif Ouahbi on Tuesday in Malaga, Spain.
Speaking at the high-level ministerial meeting held within the framework of the international conference on human rights, civil society, and the fight against terrorism, Ouahbi stressed that Morocco has intensified its efforts to face terrorist threats at home and in the region.
During the conference, which was held between May 10-11, Ouahbi noted that Morocco has established several bodies to ensure the efficiency of its approach to combat terrorism and extremism.
He highlighted that the Rabat Court of Appeal is in charge of examining cases related to terrorism and its financing, while the courts of first instance in Rabat, Fez, Casablanca, and Marrakech handle money laundering and related cases.
The minister stressed that Morocco and the UN signed an agreement on October 2020 under which the UNOCT Program Office for Counter-Terrorism in Africa, the first on the continent, was established.
The office seeks to develop and implement appropriate programs to consolidate capacities and skills in the fight against terrorism.
The Moroccan official also recalled the implementation of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), the National Financial Intelligence Authority, and the National Committee for the Implementation of UN Security Council sanctions related to terrorism and the arms proliferation and their financing.
Several member states and entities of the UN global counter-terrorism coordination compact, as well as international organizations, and human rights experts, participated in the ministerial conference to strengthen the communities’ resilience against violent extremism.
Last week, a joint operation by Morocco’s BCIJ and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) resulted in the  arrest of an ISIS-affiliated suspect in the city of Berkane, northeastern Morocco.
Investigations established that the suspect was involved in preparing a violent extremist attack to undermine Morocco’s stability and security.
US and Moroccan security services have long cooperated in counter-terrorism cases, with Washington considering Rabat an important security ally and a counter-terrorism bulwark in the MENA region.

The last general election in Lebanon took place in 2018. Since then, national economic issues have worsened, and the capital Beirut was hit with a devastating explosion in August 2020. Much of the city’s port and other buildings were heavily damaged.
Hezbollah won the 2018 election, but public unrest has resulted in a shift in public opinion. According to a poll conducted in February, 25.7% of voters are predicted to choose an independent candidate, with Hezbollah estimated to receive 14.7% of the vote.
Like the Arab League, the European Union announced in February that it would be deploying a mission to oversee the elections. Member of the European Parliament Gyorgy Holvenyi was appointed as Chief Observer for the mission. Holvenyi said, “My hope is that our work can help to foster confidence and further reinforce the democratic process in the country”.
Thousands of Lebanese citizens living abroad will also have their say in the elections, with over 130,000 voting on May 8. At home, there is hope that turnout will be higher than before. In 2018, only 49% of eligible citizens cast their vote.

Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Wopke Hoekstra expressed his country’s support for Morocco’s initiative during a meeting today with his Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita.
Following the meeting, the Netherlands and Morocco published a joint press release in which the European country conveyed its new position.
The news comes amid growing support for Morocco’s position on Western Sahara.
After the US’ recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in December 2020, many other countries have officially endorsed the Moroccan autonomy initiative, describing it  as the most serious and credible basis to end the Sahara dispute.
In March, Spain publicly announced its support of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, calling the Moroccan proposal the “most serious and credible” solution for Western Sahara.
A few days after Spain’s endorsement, France reiterated its support for the Moroccan initiative and touted cooperation with Morocco.
In December 2021, Germany announced Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as an “important contribution” from Morocco to resolve the dispute over the Sahara.
As part of today’s meeting, the Netherlands and Morocco jointly reaffirmed their support for Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy for Western Sahara, urging him to continue his efforts for a “political process that seeks to achieve a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution” in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was among the A-list of the potential attendees, did not make his trip to Morocco due to COVID-19.
On Tuesday, Blinekn and Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita held a phone call in which the US official expressed “his regret” at not being able to participate in the meeting.
US Under-Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland will represent Blinken during the meeting.
In his opening remarks during the coalition meeting, Bourita extended his words of “sympathy” to his “dear friend and colleague Secretary of State Antony Blinken.”
He said of Blinken’s absence from the meeting, “We had planned to meet in Marrakech, for our 3rd meeting in only a few weeks. But Covid-19 decided otherwise. I send him my greetings and best wishes for a speedy and full recovery.”
Bourita also extolled the “central role” Blinken played in bringing life to the Marrakech Global Coalition, saying that he is certain like everyone else that the US official “has the same will to see this meeting’s results sustained over time and that he will ensure its successful follow-up.”
The top Moroccan diplomat expressed satisfaction with the coalition’s efforts in challenging terror threats despite COVID-19.
He said the coalition was able to  reinforce its actions against terrorism, emphasizing that the “unprecedented” number of  representatives from different countries in Africa and Asia reflects “another force multiplier in achieving this objective.”
But global terrorism's threat to worldwide stability and security has not diminished despite bold efforts and substantial achievements by governments, Bourita reminded participants.
“ISIS holds the infamous record of becoming the world's deadliest terrorist group in 2021,” he said, recalling a resurgent ISIS is increasingly expanding in Africa.
“Compared to the pre-pandemic period, violence has increased on the continent, with a 40 to 60% rise in terms of fatalities and attacks,” Bourita argued.
The Moroccan foreign minister shared alarming numbers on ISIS’s presence on the continent, saying that sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 48% of global terrorism deaths and 3,461 casualties. The number brought the death toll to 30,0000 people during the last 15 years.
Renewed Concerns Regarding The Sahel
The Moroccan FM also recalled the situation in the Sahel region, an area frequently described by top security officials as a breeding ground for terror groups.
“The Sahel is home to the world’s fastest-growing and most-deadly terrorist groups,” Bourita said, stressing that the region accounts for 35% of global terrorism deaths in 2021.
Terror-related fatalities increased in the region by more than 1,000% between 2007 and 2021.
Morocco has long expressed concerns regarding the situation in the Sahel, regretting the lack of joint responsibility to defeat ISIS threats in the region.
Haboub Cherkaoui, Head of Morocco's Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ), has repeatedly renewed calls for a shared responsibility against ISIS in a recent interview with Spanish news agency EFE.
“The focus that bothers and worries Morocco the most, currently, is the Sahel area, which has become a safe and fertile refuge for terrorist networks,” the BCIJ chief warned in a recent interview.
BCIJ is known as Morocco’s FBI, mobilizing its personnel against the scourge of terror cells in the North African country.
Cherkaoui emphasized that ISIS loyals and sympathizers are eager to join the terrorist group’s ranks in conflict zones like the Sahel.
“Most of the firearms seized with the [ISIS-affiliated] detainees [arrested in Morocco] come from the sub-Saharan region,” he noted.
Bourita echoed Cherkaoui’s remarks, saying that West Africa and the Sahel are the most impacted regions by insecurity in Africa, with over 1.4 million people internally displaced due to ongoing confrontations.
“Today, 27 terrorist entities based in Africa are registered on the UN Security Council Sanction list. This is a clear indicator of their connections to major global terrorist Groups,” he said.

46,Israeli Troops Kill Prominent Palestinian Journalist Shireen Abu Akleh,Akleh was one of the most prominent journalists at Al Jazeera.,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 11, 2022 10:53 a.m.","Israeli forces have once again sparked outrage following the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh, a veteran Al Jazeera reporter and one of the most prominent and admired journalists in the Arab world.  
The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed the news of Akleh’s death, saying that Israeli forces killed the veteran Al Jazeera journalist with a live bullet on Wednesday.
Abu Akleh was covering Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, the ministry noted, adding that she was murdered despite wearing her press vest and helmet. The journalist was taken to the hospital in critical condition after being critically wounded, and she was later pronounced dead by the personnel.
A Jerusalem-born reporter, 51-year-old Shireen Abu Akleh studied architecture in Jordan before joining Yarmouk University in the same country to pursue her journalism career.
Following her graduation, she went back to Palestine, where she served as a journalist in local media.
She joined Al Jazeera in 1997, where she established herself as one of the most well-known and admired reporters of the Arab world.
Photos and videos documenting the killing of the journalist have gone viral online.
The death of the much-admired and revered Palestinian journalist has left many shocked across the world.
“The brilliant journalist Shreen Abu Akleh was executed today with cold hands by Israeli Army, even though she was wearing a press label,” said one comment onTwitter.
“The daughter of Jerusalem, the Knight of the Truth. There is no immunity for any Palestinian, even if he is to be protected by international laws. A paramedic, a journalist, there is no difference -- all are legitimate targets, without money, not even accountability,” noted another Twitter user.
According to Al Jazeera, gunshots by Israeli troops also injured one of its journalists named Ali Samoudi. 
Samoudi was shot in the back, Al Jazeera reported, adding: “He is now in a stable condition, and said that there were no Palestinian fighters present when the journalists were shot, directly disputing an Israeli statement that referenced the possibility.”
The wounded Al Jazeera journalist emphasized that he and Shireen were going to film “the Israeli army operation and suddenly they shot us without asking us to leave or stop filming.”
Another Palestinian journalist, Shatha Hanaysha, confirmed that there were no confrontations between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli troops during the killing of Shireen Akleh.
“We were four journalists, we were all wearing vests, all wearing helmets,” Hanaysha told Al Jazeera.
“The [Israeli] occupation army did not stop firing even after she collapsed. I couldn’t even extend my arm to pull her because of the shots. The army was adamant on shooting to kill.”

The three countries are participating in a two-day workshop from May 10-11 in Marrakech to share expertise and “successful strategies” to counter money laundering crimes, said a statement from the US Embassy in Rabat.
The US Department of Justice’s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) and the Moroccan government, jointly organized the workshop with the goal of demonstrating the joint US-Moroccan commitment to “combatting criminal organizations and blocking their access to illicit financing,” noted the statement.
Lawerence Randolph, the US Consul General in Casablanca, said that prosecutors and legal representatives convened in the workshop to work together to “make Moroccan money laundering prosecutions more impactful.”
“The more that law enforcement can attack criminals’ ability to launder money, the less incentive it is for criminals to engage in crime in the first place,”  the consul general added in his opening remarks at the workshop.
The US embassy said that the participants will discuss different aspects, including  “Moroccan legal tools available to bring money laundering charges alongside substantive criminal charges, as well as specific techniques to develop deeper financial investigations.”    
Panels will also outline how to allow prosecutors from each country to work together with international law enforcement partners on money laundering investigations. 
Article 3.1 of the 1988 UN Vienna Convention describes money laundering as the “conversion or transfer of property,  knowing that such property is derived from any offense(s), for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in such offense(s) to evade the legal consequences of his actions.”
The UN encourages states to counter money laundering through different means, including raising public awareness about the challenge.
Morocco is no exception to money laundering challenges, with the country emphasizing its commitment to strengthening its strategy to fight both the issue and terrorist financing. In recent months, the Moroccan government has spoken of the importance of training law enforcement officers to combat money laundering.

“The fight against desertification and land degradation is an existential struggle for everyone – and even more so in Africa,” the speech, which was delivered by the Minister of Agriculture Mohamed Sadiki, continued. “This fight should not be hampered by a lack of technological capabilities or financial resources, much less political will.”
Morocco has made strides as a regional leader in the fight against climate change. In late 2021, the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) ranked the country fifth worldwide for its efforts to combat climate change in accordance with the 2015 Paris Agreement.
The North African kingdom has also signed several agreements with countries such as the UK to combat the climate crisis on an international scale.

49,US State Secretary to Visit Morocco to Discuss Fight Against Daesh,"The Global Coalition Against Daesh was created in 2014, and includes more than 80 states and international organizations.",Oussama Aamari,"May 09, 2022 3:04 p.m.","Rabat - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Morocco on May 11 to participate in the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition Against Daesh, it was confirmed today.
Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita will also participate in the meeting, which will take place in Marrakech.
Blinken had discussed the Marrakech conference with Bourita during his visit to Morocco in late March, in which he also praised Morocco’s contribution to regional security and the fight against terrorism.
“The Marrakech meeting constitutes another step in the pursuit of international coordination and engagement in the fight against Daesh,” an official communique said today.
The ministers attending the meeting will review actions taken so far to fight the terrorist organization, stabilization efforts in the areas previously affected by Daesh, and strategies to fight against radicalization propaganda and foreign fighters.
In December 2021, the coalition launched its “Africa Focus Group,” a think-tank that aims to improve stability and anti-terrorism measures in the continent. The group is co-chaired by Morocco, Nigeria, Italy, and the US.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates the economic effect of terrorism on Africa to have reached $171 billion in 2019, with the continent having 27 terrorist entities that are on the UN Security Council list as terrorist groups.
Bourita said in the 2021 conference that these groups were responsible for the deaths of over 12,000 people in 2020.
Representatives from the coalition’s over 80 member states and organizations are expected to attend the meeting in Marrakech.
Blinken’s presence is also expected to strengthen the ties and collaboration between Washington, D.C. and Rabat. The Secretary of State had previously touted the long-standing relations between the two and committed to more cooperation across all sectors.

50,2 Found Guilty of Attempting to Recruit Moroccans for Terrorist Groups in Spain,"The two defendants were active in targeting youth, particularly Moroccans for terror-related recruitment.",Safaa Kasraoui,"May 09, 2022 11:23 a.m.","Rabat - The National Court in Spain found last week two men guilty of attempting to recruit young Moroccans to terrorist groups including ISIS in Donostia, north-western Spain.
Europa Press reported on Sunday that Spain’s National Court found Mohamed C. and Anass.E guilty of carrying out “massive” recruitment for terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and Al Qaeda.
The two suspects were targeting young Moroccans in Donostia, the Spanish outlet said, adding that the public prosecutor's office requested nine years in prison for Mohamed and five years for Anase for the crime of “terrorist indoctrination.”
Once released, the suspects would also face eight years of supervision, and each of the defendants will pay a fine of €3,000.
Mohamed.C took advantage of his position as an imam or preacher of the mosque in Herrera and at the Islamic Cultural Association in San Sebastian to find new recruits, including children.
According to the investigation, Mohamed C had contacts with other members that were publishing propaganda materials glorifying terrorism.
He and Anass E collaborated on social networks to “extol jihadist terrorist groups, their members and leaders, justifying their activity and inciting the commission of violent actions and suicide attacks,” according to Europa Press.
The preliminary investigation established that Mohamed. C had been running a “massive activity” online since 2012, with an “enormous capacity for disseminating content.”
Messages sent to targeted people for recruitment mentioned terror attacks, such as September 11 in Newyork.
“One of them, published on December 9, 2013, was a “gory image of a man dressed like a soldier who had died violently,” the news outlet added.
As it has been targeted by numerous terrorist groups in recent years, Spain has been intensifying efforts and collaboration to combat terrorism.
The European country maintains a strong counterterrorism collaboration with Morocco, one of its strongest allies in the field.
On April 30, an anti-crime cooperation deal between Spain and Morocco entered into force.
Spain and Morocco signed the agreement in February 2019 to tackle all forms of organized crime, particularly terrorism.
During Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s visit to Morocco in April, both countries agreed to intensify cooperation as part of their new roadmap for sustainable and ambitious cooperation. 
Last week, Spain transferred to Morocco a previously convicted extremist involved in the March 11, 2004 attacks in Madrid, one of the most heinous attacks in Spain's history. The terror attack resulted in the killing of 193 people, with over 1,800 injured.

51,Angola Seeks to Strengthen Relations With Morocco,Could this mean that Angola may soon join the growing list of African countries shifting their position on Western Sahara in favor of Morocco’s territorial integrity?,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 08, 2022 2:15 p.m.","Rabat - Angola’s roving ambassador Bernardo Mbala Domble met with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, carrying a message to King Mohammed VI from Angolan President Joao Lourenco.
Moroccan state media reported that the meeting took place on Friday but did reveal details about the Angolan President's message to King Mohammed VI.
But Ambassador Domble made a statement to the press, conveying his country’s readiness to strengthen the “friendly relations that bind Angola and Morocco, two countries that share a common history.”
The Angolan diplomat explained, “Angola and Morocco have a common history. Morocco was the first country to support Angola through the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, and the first President of the Republic of Angola, Antonio Agostinho Neto, had a friendly relationship with the Kingdom.”
Angola considers Morocco a “friend of Angola,” Ambassador Domble said, stressing the need to “further strengthen their relations.”
Angola has been among African countries that have maintained relations with the Polisario Front, a separatist group claiming independence for Western Sahara.
Following the departure of former President of Angola Jose Eduardo  Dos Santos, there were reports on “intensified” discussions between Luanda and Rabat to strengthen diplomatic ties.
Dos Santos, who served as Angola's president 1979 to 2017,  had been a vocal supporter of the Polisario Front during his time as president.
In March 2021, Morocco renewed its determination to promote economic and trade relations with  Angola as part of a bid to increase cooperation between economic operators from the two countries.
Both countries also expressed their determination to accelerate the process of signing several draft agreements of an economic and commercial nature.
The agreements have been technically finalized and cover cooperation on avoidance of double taxation, air services, reciprocal protection of investment, and trade cooperation.
But whether Angola will change its stance on the Western Sahara dispute and join the growing list of African countries supporting Morocco’s territorial integrity -- is yet to be unveiled in the future.
In recent years, Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara has gained widespread international recognition with the opening of consulates general in the Moroccan southern provinces of Laayoune and Dakhla.
The provinces are currently home to over 20 diplomatic representations of African and Arab countries that have cemented their support for Morocco’s position on Western Sahara.
Senegal, Malawi, and Zambia along with several other countries have all opened consulates in the region, reflecting their unwavering commitment to the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for the disputed region.
Arab countries such as the UAE, Jordan, and  Bahrain have also opened representations in the region, reaffirming their support for Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara.

52,Algeria Reduces Gas Supply to Spain by 25%,Algeria has been threatening to “recalculate” gas supply to Spain since the Spanish decision to endorse Morocco’s autonomy initiative.,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 08, 2022 12:50 p.m.","Rabat - Algeria has reduced its gas supply to Spain, according to the Spanish news outlet El Economista.
Quoting data from Spain’s energy company Enagas, the news outlet documented how gas supply to Spain through Medgaz, a pipeline supplying Spain with Algerian gas, has fallen by 25% in the last week compared to levels recorded in mid-March.
“Since last May 1, 234 (gigawatts/day) have been entering, compared to 312 GWh/day that was registered on March 14,” El Economista said.
The Spanish news outlet attributed the Algerian move to Spain’s decision to endorse Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the “most serious and credible” basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara.
Spain ended a year-long dispute with Morocco in March after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez addressed a letter to King Mohammed VI to announce his country’s endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.
The Moroccan government appreciated Spain’s support and agreed to reopen a new phase of relations based on transparency, mutual respect, and strengthened cooperation at all levels.
Spain’s decision frustrated the Algerian regime, which recalled its ambassador to Madrid to protest against Madrid’s change on Western Sahara.
Sonatrach, Algeria’s oil company, has also been threatening to “recalculate” gas prices to Spain, while the Algerian Ministry of Energy has publicly announced its willingness to end the gas contract with Spain if the European country sells the product to Morocco.
The Algerian threats reflect the country’s hostility and continued lobbying to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara.
Algeria has been supporting, backing, financing, sheltering, and arming the Polisario Front - a separatist group claiming independence over Western Sahara.
Addressing the threats and protestations from Algeria, Spain’s Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Albares has suggested that no external maneuvers would change or derail his country’s “sovereign decision” to endorse Morocco’s Autonomy Plan and deepen bilateral cooperation with Rabat. 
The supply of gas from Algeria to Spain has “slowly decreased,” El Economista reported, adding: “The entry of gas for this month of May is even lower than the figure compared to May of last year, without taking into account the expansion of capacity.”
The Spanish news outlet quoted sources from the energy industry as saying that the reduction of Algeria’s gas supply is due to the “normal flow of demand.”
“This is not usual since the European Commission is trying to impose storage levels of 80% for all European countries and the gas shortage is causing an increase in electricity prices,” the Spanish news outlet argued.

53,Morocco and Quebec Commit to Deepening Bilateral Relations,Morocco and Canada recently stated their intentions to deepen cooperation in a number of areas of shared interest.,Oussama Aamari,"May 07, 2022 4:31 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s Consul General to Montreal, M'hamed Ifriquine, met with Minister of International Relations and Francophonie of the Canadian province, Nadine Girault, and the two officials pledged to deepen bilateral relations between Morocco and Quebec.
Girault expressed satisfaction with the relations between the two, while also adding that a trade delegation from Quebec will be visiting Morocco to identify areas of potential collaboration.
Ifriquine similarly said that the relations with Quebec are a “considerable” part of Moroccan-Canadian ties, especially when it comes to education, trade, and culture.
As this year marks the 60th anniversary of Moroccan-Canadian relations, there have been several meetings between high-level officials from both countries to discuss deepening cooperation.
In particular, the educational and cultural sectors have seen increased cooperation between the two countries. Morocco hosted an academic day in partnership with Concordia University, where academics and policymakers discussed their experiences in educational cooperation.
The University’s President, Graham Carr, expressed eagerness to partner with Moroccan institutions to welcome more Moroccan students to the university as part of regular studies or exchange programs.
Ifriquine said the Moroccan Cultural Center in Montreal will play a big role in bringing the two countries closer together and exposing Canadians to Moroccan culture.
He also noted increased economic cooperation, expressing hopes to extend cooperation to professional training, in the hopes of fulfilling job demands for various sectors both in Morocco and Canada.
Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Melanie Joy, his Canadian counterpart, had expressed similar hopes earlier this year, also pledging to develop a roadmap for deepening ties this year.
Enhanced political cooperation is also an important issue for the two, as they stated their countries’ commitment to working in the framework of international organizations and diplomacy to deal with regional and international issues.

54,G77 Group Convenes in Vienna Under Morocco’s Leadership,"The meeting discussed improving justice systems, crime prevention, and ways to combat drug problems.",Oussama Aamari,"May 07, 2022 2:18 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco chaired a meeting of the council of ambassadors of the G77 group in Vienna, with the attendees discussing the group’s priorities in regards to the agenda of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
Morocco’s Representative to the United Nations Office in Vienna, Azzeddine Farhane, chaired the meeting and talked about the strategies that Morocco and Africa are adopting to curb the drug problem and combat crime.
“These strategies include strengthening crime prevention, improving the justice system, ensuring a balanced response to the drug scourge, improving laws and legislation, building resilience, and contributing safely and effectively to international efforts to address the most pressing challenges and threats to sustainable development in our time,” Farhane said.
He argued that Morocco values dialogue and considers it “a priority” when it comes to achieving common goals and establishing close interaction among heads of international organizations based in Vienna.
Other programs adopted by regions such as South America and South East Asia were also praised during the meeting.
Farhane added that the G77 group nations, due to their status as developing countries and the disproportionate effect that the COVID-19 pandemic and security problems have had, face even tougher challenges in strengthening their institutions and combating crime.
Ghada Waly, Director General of UNDOC, also attended the meeting and welcomed the “valuable initiative” undertaken by Morocco.
She echoed Farhane’s sentiments about the need to strengthen cooperation between the UN agency and countries all over the world, as well as regional organizations such as the African Union.
“In a world full of crises, developing countries bear greater consequences. The pandemic and its aftermath have affected everyone, but they hit developing countries the hardest,” she pointed out.
The disproportionate effect of global crises such as the threat of organized crime on developing countries has always been cause for concern. Faced with highly organized crime networks, already vulnerable institutions in the Global South can suffer great damages that result in a decreased ability -- and sometimes downright inability --  to execute some existing laws.
In Morocco, government agencies such as the DGSN regularly dismantle drug trafficking networks and other criminal institutions, and cooperate regularly with neighbors such as Spain and other European countries.

55,Minister of Agriculture Calls to Accelerate Amazigh Officialization,Morocco allocated MAD 200 million earlier this year to officialize the language in various aspects of daily life.,Oussama Aamari,"May 06, 2022 4:12 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture Mohamed Sadiki has expressed his support for speeding up the process to officialize the Amazigh language, and make it a language on par with Arabic in official use.
The minister called the implementation of the language “a responsibility that everyone bears,” adding that the language is a crucial component of the Moroccan linguistic makeup.
The minister expressed his opinion during a signing ceremony of an officialization agreement between the ministry and the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture.
Sadiki further stated that the Amazigh language and culture is a national treasure, and should be given all the tools to allow it to flourish and be taught officially.
Morocco’s government has recently attempted to fasttrack the process that would see Amazigh become a truly official language. Earlier this year, it allocated a budget of MAD 200 million ($20 million) toward this cause.
The government upon being elected vowed to “catch up” with the delay in making the language official, guaranteeing that it will be institutionalized.

The language would be used in education, legislation, information and communication, in a similar capacity to Arabic or French, should the ambitions to institutionalize it go through.
“We are compelled, now more than ever, to be involved in workshops to make Amazigh the official language,” Sadiki added. “This is a national responsibility, as His Majesty the King had outlined in his speech for the Throne Day.”
The ministry’s agreement with the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture constitutes one of the steps for the government’s program to officialize the language.
The process is expected to take 15 years, with the program dividing its targets into short-term and long-term goals.
The language has already been implemented in some of the ministry’s websites and online forms, as well as its slogans and public communications.

Starting May 13, Jean-Pierre will replace departing White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki to serve as principal deputy press secretary. 
Psaki has stated from the beginning that she would step down during Biden's presidency. According to U.S. media reports, the outgoing spokeswoman will join the left-leaning US television channel MSNBC, where she will host her own show.
“She will be the first black and openly LGBTQ+ woman” in the position, Psaki tweeted after the announcement, adding, “she will give a voice to many, but also make many dream big about what is truly possible.”
According to a White House statement, Biden was “proud” of his appointment. The president also praised his prospective spokesperson's “experience, talent, and honesty.”
“Karin not only brings the experience, talent, and integrity needed for this difficult job, but she will continue to lead the way in communicating about the work of the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of the American people,” the US president said in a statement.
Karine Jean-Pierre: everything Trump hates 
Born in Martinique to Haitian parents who later emigrated to the United States, Karine Jean-Pierre grew up in New York City, where her father worked as a cab driver and her mother as a home health care nurse.
She attended the elite Columbia University before engaging in the worlds of associations and politics.
Jean-Pierre has frequently stated that her family's history, which exemplifies the “American dream,” was a determining factor in her career.
She worked on both of Barack Obama's campaigns (2008 and 2012) and then Joe Biden's in 2020, before joining his team in the White House.

58,Israeli Supreme Court Legalizes Masafer Yatta Evictions,"Israeli efforts to take over Palestine lands continue, fueling a new wave of local and international condemnation.",Souad Anouar,"May 06, 2022 11:58 a.m.","Rabat - Israel’s Supreme Court has concluded a two-decade legal procedure by allowing the forcible transfer of hundreds of Palestinians from Masafer Yatta to establish a military firing zone.
In the 1980s, the Israeli army declared Masafer Yatta, 3,000 hectares of privately owned Palestinian agricultural land in the South Hebron Hills, as “Firing Zone 918.”
On Wednesday, the court dismissed all petitions condemning the expulsion of hundreds of Palestinians from their properties and land. 
According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Israeli authorities issued evacuation orders for Masafer Yatta inhabitants in the early 2000s, meaning that the latest court ruling just officialized and accelerated the expulsion procedure.
“The occupation court just decided: My community will be destroyed. I live in Masafer Yatta, Palestine. An unjust 23 year long trial ended today with a verdict of mass eviction. The army can now place us on trucks, 2,400 people, and expel us from our ancient villages, one by one,” Palestinian journalist Basel Adra tweeted on Wednesday. 
The court said that the Palestinian people inhabiting the area had a nomadic way of life, meaning that they had not been permanent residents. Israel’s military justified the need for a firing range in the area for security reasons, adding that Palestinians had built in the area without a legal permit.
The court’s ruling sparked Palestinian and international uproar with some Israeli rights groups refuting the decision.
Nidal Abu Younis, Masafer Yatta’s Mayor, told Reuters that the latest ruling “proves that this court is part of the occupation…We are not going to leave our homes. We will stay here.”

Caroline Ort, who serves as the Norwegian Refugee Council’s country director for Palestine, noted that the “court ruling effectively opens the door for the Israeli military to uproot entire Palestinian communities that have lived in Masafer Yatta for decades.”
Ort further underlined that the decision would cause “irredeemable” damage to the livelihood of Masafer Yatta’s inhabitants. In this sense, she called for the reversal of such a “dangerous step” that violates international law to stop “Israel as an occupying power from transferring members of the occupied population from their existing communities against their will.”
The Europe Union Delegation to the Palestinians also highlighted the prohibition of “individual or mass forcible transfers and deportation from occupied territories” under international law. “Israel has the obligation to protect the Palestinian population & not displace it,” it added.
Since 2011, Israeli authorities have demolished or confiscated more than 200 Palestinian properties in “Firing Zone 918”, leading to the displacement of 608 Palestinians, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Currently, roughly 30% of zones of “Area C” in the occupied West Bank are designated as “firing zones.” 
The tragic news regarding Masafer Yatta follows a pattern of systematic attacks on Palestinians that aim to steal their lands, identity, and history.

59,"BCIJ, FBI Cooperate in Arrest of ISIS Suspect in Morocco",The suspect is suspected of planning terror projects targeting Moroccan and foreign targets.,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 06, 2022 11:20 a.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) arrested today an ISIS-affiliated suspect in the city of Berkane, in northeastern Morocco.
A statement from the BCIJ said that the 37-year-old man is suspected of being involved in preparing a violent extremist attack to undermine Morocco’s stability and security.
The arrest of the suspect came as a result of security cooperation with Moroccan security units, including BCIJ, judicial police, as well as US authorities.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in collaboration with Morocco’s BCIJ and the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (DGST) carried out joint technical research and investigation, identifying the suspect and his extremist project.
Preliminary investigation shows that the suspect was “managing and running a closed group on one of the communication platforms, adopting extremist goals and projects.”
The group aimed to attract and recruit other people to carry out extremist attacks against Moroccan and foreign targets.
The investigation also showed that the suspêct was in contact with the leader of a terror cell that was dismantled on March 25, 2021, in the city of Oujda in Morocco’s Oriental region.
The contact was made in order to secure financial resources for logistical support.
Security services put the suspect in custody for further investigation to determine the extent of his extremist activities, as well as his possible links with terror organizations inside and outside Morocco.
BCIJ concluded its statement by emphasizing that today’s security operation proves the risk of the extremist threat that Morocco continues to face.
“This operation also embodies the importance of joint and advanced bilateral cooperation with the United States of America in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism.
This is not the first time the US and Morocco’s security services cooperate together in counter-terrorism cases.
In December 2021, BCIJ, DGST, and the General Directorate of the National Security (DGSN) collaborated closely with US intelligence to arrest an ISIS-linked suspect.
The arrested suspect was plotting extremist attacks against Morocco.
The US views Morocco an important ally in countering terrorism. In December last year, the US State Department’s Country Report on Terrorism said  Morocco’s strategy against terrorism as “comprehensive.”
The report also commended Morocco’s “vigilant security measures, regional and international cooperation, and terrorist counter-radicalization policies.”

Israeli troops stormed the mosque’s compound, causing injuries to at least 16 Palestinains.
Al Jazeera reported that the attack resulted in 50 arrests among ¨Palestinians. Two of the injured  victims sustained injuries from beatings, the news outlet added.
Some of the Palestinians received injuries from rubber coated bullets and tear gas suffocation.
Al Aqsa mosque has recently seen a resurgence of a series of violent attacks, targeting Palestinians in the past weeks.
Israeli troops continue to carry out violent attacks against Palestinians despite a global uproar.
The Palestinian government has called on the UN Security Council to intervene, and bear responsibility to end Israel’s violanet attacks.
A recent statement from the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the Security Council to ""take the necessary measures to pressure the Israeli government to stop its aggression and escalation against the Palestinians and force it to abide by international law.""
The Palestinian government accused the Security Council of abondoning its responsibilities and failute to “fulfill its obligations.”
The Palestinian foreign ministry added that inaction from the UN allows the “constant violations and crimes of Israeli racist colonialism against our people.”
Many countries have condemned and rejected the  Israeli attacks, including Morocco.
The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs said in April that the country had summoned the head of the Israeli Liaison Office in Rabat to inform him of Morocco’s firm rejection of Israeli attacks on Palestinians.

61,Russia Sanctions: EU Considering Oil Embargo,The EU intends to impose an oil embargo on Russia in order to punish it for its ongoing attacks on Ukraine.,Aya Benazizi,"May 04, 2022 5:08 p.m.","Casablanca - As Russian troops launch further attacks on eastern Ukraine and the blockaded Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol, the EU announced today that it will impose an oil embargo on Russia.
“Today, we will propose to ban all Russian oil from Europe,” the European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen told the chamber in Strasbourg, vowing to minimize the damage to the European economy.
The sanctions should involve “a complete import ban on all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined,” Von der Leyen added.
The goal of these oil sanctions is to “make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, in a way that allows us and our partners to secure alternative supply routes and minimizes the impact on global markets,” she underlined.
The sanctions proposals will be discussed by the EU's 27 member states.

As the EU advocated a phased oil embargo against Russia, von der Leyen insisted in a speech at the European Parliament that “Putin must pay a price, a high price, for his brutal aggression.”
Although the EU envoys held preliminary talks today regarding the potential oil boycott on Russia, no agreement was made and the group remained divided.
A number of EU countries that are largely reliant on Russian oil imports, notably Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, voiced concerns about some other member states’ gung-ho approach to the proposed oil embargo.
Bulgaria's deputy prime minister, Assen Vassilev, said that his country will seek an exemption from the impending sanctions that will cut off Russian oil imports.
Hungary and Slovakia also requested an exception, noting they will continue to purchase Russian crude oil under current contracts until the end of 2023.
The European Union's decision to prohibit Russian oil will certainly cause enormous dilemmas and friction among member states, but many observers and more determined EU member states expect the proposed sanctions will be implemented if influential EU nations such as Germany demonstrate sufficient commitment.
Despite being one of the countries with a history of heavy reliance on Russian oil, Poland has emerged as the most vocal advocate of the “de-Russification” of Europe’s energy market. 
“I hope that by… May at the latest we will have completely exited Russian coal,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki insisted in remarks made a month ago. “We will do everything to stop using Russian oil by the end of this year.”

In an interview with the Italian daily Il Giornale, Balla underlined Morocco’s leadership role in promoting “peace and security, particularly in Africa, where extremism, organized crime and separatism are on the rise.”
The Moroccan diplomat highlighted the North African kingdom’s fight against terrorism and extremism and the country’s efforts to consolidate its military security. 
Morocco’s hosting of the anti-Daesh coalition meeting comes in vindication of the country’s international reputation as a reliable regional partner in the global fight to dismantle radical and criminal networks, said Il Giornale.

The coming anti-Daesh coalition meeting will bring together representatives of more than 92 countries, added Balla.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also expected to visit Marrakech on May 11 for the meeting. While the meeting’s official agenda is yet to be announced, current political developments in the Sahel will most likely be one of the major talking points. 
Formed in September 2014, the anti-Daesh coalition consists of 84 members committed to weakening Daesh by targeting its financial and economic infrastructures, launching military campaigns in Iraq and Syria, countering the group’s propaganda, and supporting peace restoration in liberated areas. 
The coalition initially focused on Iraq and Syria where Daesh was on the rise. Yet the fall of Daesh in the Middle East has shifted the international coalition’s focus to the Sahel. 
Defined by structural political and economic weaknesses, the rising flow of arms from Libya, and continuous external interventions, the Sahel is considered a “safe haven” for extremist groups.
Amid alarming reports of increasing insecurity in the already fragile and politically unstable Sahel, Morocco has repeatedly called on regional and global powers to adopt a “shared responsibility” approach to address insecurity in the region.   
Habboub Cherkaoui, the head of Morocco’s Central Bureau of Judicial Investigations (BCIJ) said in April that Morocco is mostly worried about the Sahel since it “has become a safe and fertile refuge for terrorist networks.”

63,Ukraine War: Russia Intensifies Assaults on Azovstal Steel Mill,Russia seeks to overtake the strategic Azovstal steel mill as part of its campaign to subjugate eastern Ukraine.,Aya Benazizi,"May 04, 2022 2:59 p.m.","Casablanca - After weeks of intense bombing in eastern Ukraine, Russian forces are now intensifying their campaign to overtake the Azovstal steel mill, with the latest assaults having resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of Ukrainians. 
The Russia-Ukraine conflict reached its 70th day today, and explosions are still being reported in various Ukrainian cities. 
After being trapped for many days in the besieged city of Mariupol, around 100 residents had been evacuated from the Azovstal steel mill, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
In a tweet yesterday, the UN said that it had successfully evacuated more than a hundred individuals from the Azovstal steel mill.
President Zelensky announced in a Facebook video on Tuesday evening that 156 individuals had been evacuated and arrived in Zaporizhia, a Ukrainian-controlled town 230 kilometers northwest of Mariupol.
Zelenskyy accused Russian soldiers of violating the truce by continuing to attack the Azovstal steel facility and attempting to storm it.

“I am grateful to all of those on whom the rescue of these people depended. Who agreed and who helped. I am grateful to everyone who ensured the physical movement of people through the humanitarian corridor,” Zelenskyy added.
The head of Ukrainian railroads, Oleksandr Kamyshin, stated that strikes carried out by Russian armed forces on Tuesday damaged six railway stations in Ukraine's central and western regions.
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Verechtchuk said that a new evacuation operation is planned for Wednesday, “if the security situation allows.”
According to Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik, while as many as 156 residents have managed to flee the besieged city of Mariupol into Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia, over 30 children remain trapped within Mariupol's Azovstal steel complex, which Russia's Ministry of Defense has “securely secured.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered his troops to blockade the Azovstal steel complex in Mariupol, where hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were still battling in the besieged port city's last standoff.
Speaking on Tuesday in support of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden stated that the US had offered more than $3 billion in security assistance to the country.
“Since Russia invaded Ukraine just over two months ago, we have sent more than $3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine — alone, us — not counting our Allies.  And that money is a direct investment in defending freedom and democracy itself,” Biden declared. 
He added, “I urge the Congress to pass this funding quickly to help Ukraine continue to succeed against Russian aggression, just as they did when they won the Battle of Kyiv, and to make sure the United States and our Allies can replenish our own stocks of weapons to replace what we've sent to Ukraine.”

64,Malta Expels Air Algerie Flight Planned to Repatriate Polisario Members,Maltese authorities emphasized that they had not agreed with Air Algerie on the repatriation.,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 04, 2022 2:20 p.m.","Rabat - Algeria is facing a new controversy after Malta authorities expelled an Air Algerie flight that was planning to repatriate Polisario members on Saturday, April 30.
The news website Algerie Part reported “confidential information” revealing that the Maltese authorities ordered the expulsion of an Air Algerie plane which had taken off completely empty from Algiers to travel to Valletta, the capital of Malta.
“It was a special flight that had been set up by the Algerian authorities with the aim of repatriating … active members of the Polisario front,” the report said, adding that the  Maltese authorities expelled the flight as they “had not given their agreement” to authorize the repatriation operation.
The Algerian flight traveled back to Algiers empty after its crew was “turned away” by Malta,, Algerie Part further explained, noting that the expulsion caused “considerable financial losses for the company given that an entire crew, an aircraft, and kerosene were mobilized.”
Read also: Post-Plane Crash Info Leak ‘Embarrasses’ Algeria, Polisario
The Algerian news website went on to describe the episode as “disturbing” for Algeria’s regime, suggesting that both Malta’s expulsion of the “special flight” and Algiers’ deafening silence about the episode point to embarrassing details for Algeria.  
“Why did Maltese authorities so brutally expel the Air Algerie flight? Who are these mysterious Polisario travelers that Algeria wanted to repatriate to Tindouf at all costs?” the website asked rhetorically. It added, “An intriguing silence reigns in Algiers in the face of these questions deemed ‘disturbing’ by all sources we have approached for the purposes of our investigation.”
Algeria has long refused to shoulder responsibility in the Western Sahara dispute although it is known for sheltering, financing, arming, and supporting the Polisario Front -- the separatist group claiming independence over the region.
But Algeria’s involvement in the dispute has time and again been reflected in many of its hostile acts towards Morocco, including its rejection of the latest UN resolution, its angry reaction to Spain for embracing Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, and its ongoing lobbying efforts to counter Morocco’s diplomatic advances in Africa and the US. 
Algerie Part’s revelation of Malta’s “disturbing” expulsion of a “special flight” the Algerian regime had arranged for the repatriation of Polisario members brings to mind another controversy the Algerian regime faced in 2018, when an Algerian military plane crashed with senior Polisario members onboard. The crash claimed the lives of over 250 passengers, including 30 Polisario members.
The presence of Polisario members in an Algerian military plane made a mockery of the Algerian regime’s long-standing denial of direct involvement in the Sahara dispute, stirring embarrassment in Algiers.

In his message, the Moroccan monarch expressed his sincere congratulations and wishes of health and prosperity to President Duda, as well as progress and prosperity to the Polish people.
The King praised the ties of friendship and collaboration that unite Morocco and Poland, emphasizing his desire to continue working with the Polish president to consolidate these connections in a wide range of sectors. 
Rabat and Warsaw have long maintained good and solid relations, and the bilateral relationship has especially blossomed in recent years. Economic cooperation and political dialogue between the two countries reached new heights in recent months despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given Morocco's stability and increasing status as the “gateway to Africa,” Poland regards the North African nation as a key partner in the region and a critical player in North Africa.
In January this year,  Abderrahim Atmoun, Morocco's ambassador to Poland, met with members of the Poland-Morocco Parliamentary Friendship Group in the lower house of the Polish parliament, to discuss ways to increase political interaction between the two nations.
Because of continuous discussion and a broad agreement on regional and international issues of mutual concern, the growing and firmly established partnership between Morocco and Poland has notably strengthened bilateral trade. 
A number of Polish firms have in recent years scaled up their investments in Morocco, particularly in the country's southern provinces.
According to Amoun, Morocco's Ambassador to Poland, Morocco's Free Trade Agreements with African countries have transformed the country into not just a transit point between Europe and Africa, but also a land of opportunity for businesses from all over the world.

66,Israel to Plan Second Regional Forum With Moroccan Participation,Two Israeli officials told Axios the visit would be part of Biden’s visit to the Middle East.,Oussama Aamari,"May 03, 2022 7:21 p.m.","Rabat - Israel is planning to hold a second regional forum with various Arab leaders, in time for US President Joe Biden’s visit to the Middle East, Axios reported on Tuesday.
Two Israeli officials told the American news website that the Israeli government and the White House are currently in talks to hold a regional summit when Biden visits at the end of June.
The talks are still preliminary and it is unclear if such a meeting will be possible, Axios said, adding that the White House declined to comment on the news.
Biden’s visit to Israel is reportedly planned to be a short one, as it would last between 24 and 36 hours, which would make hosting a summit more challenging.
The trip would be Biden’s first one to the region, but it is unclear whether he’ll be visiting other countries too.
The forum would include participants from the Negev Summit, which was recently attended by Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and representatives from Egypt, the UAE, Bahrain, and the US.
The summit ended with the leaders pledging to expand more effort into security and economic cooperation in the future.
There have been some tensions between Israel and its new Arab allies, however, as many of them condemned the country for its recent attacks on Al Aqsa mosque and the continued violence against Palestinians.
Morocco summoned Israel’s Charge d’Affaires to inform him of the country’s condemnation of Isareli forces’ raid on the mosque, with Bourita stating that it is a result of systematic discrimination against Palestinians.

With America seemingly taking a back seat from the Middle East, the summit can be a way for Biden to show his supporters and regional leaders that his country is still invested in the peace process in Palestine, as well as other regional issues, says Axios.

Sources say he passed away in his home in Harhoura after a battle with illness.
His body is expected to be transported later today to his birthplace, Sefrou, where the funeral and prayer will be held.
Sekkouri was a leading figure in the Popular Movement party, holding many positions throughout different ministries and administrations.
After obtaining a graduate degree in political science, Sekkouri studied at the French Institute of Administrative Sciences and trained in Development Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, according to his biography on the Ministry of Youth’s website.
Sekkouri assumed several positions in different ministries. He was a human resources manager at the Ministry of Agriculture, particularly in the Water and Forests department, before becoming an advisor to Mohand Laenser during his time as Minister of the Interior.
With his expertise in bureaucracy and administrative sciences, the deceased politician was also a professor in the subjects at the National School for Administration, organizing training courses at various institutions across Morocco.
Sekkouri held the position of Minister of Youth from October 2015, when he was appointed by King Mohammed VI, until October 2016, after he was elected to the House of Representatives.

On religious and national holidays such as the Eids, the King has been known to issue pardons and reduce sentences for prisoners.
Of the 645 prisoners who have been pardoned, 622 have received a reduction in their sentences rather than a release, the Ministry of Justice said. Another 22 received a complete release, and one saw their sentence reduced from a life sentence to a timed one.
284 people out on bail have been pardoned as well, and 191 of them will no longer have to pay court fines as part of the pardon.
According to the ministry, the pardon only applies to a specific selection of prisoners who are chosen on a strict set of objective criteria.
The pardon included 29 prisoners convicted of terrorism and extremism, who have shown that they are rehabilitated and no longer hold extremist views.
Of these prisoners, 23 were released, while 6 saw their sentences reduced.
The releases from prison will be made on a gradual basis with oversight from relevant and local authorities.
In addition to forgiving inmates who have shown good behavior and a willingness to reintegrate into society, the pardon also alleviates some of the crowding problems in prison.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic's far-reaching consequences over the last two years, crowding issues have been a particularly important aspect of improving prisons in Morocco.
Inmates in Moroccan prisons this year will be allowed to receive baskets of food and other goods from their families and relatives.
A recent report by Morocco's General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR) outlined plans to make detention conditions more humane, as well as to support social reintegration efforts by former inmates.

The lawmaker admitted to watching pornography twice in the house of commons after two female MPs had reported him.
Rabat - Neil Parish, politician of the Tory party, the leading conservative party in the UK, announced that he is officially resigning from his political duties after admitting to watching pornography twice in the parliament.
Speaking to the BBC yesterday, Parish admitted to watching pornography in the house of commons, saying that he was caught in a “moment of madness.”
The British lawmaker proceeded to explain that the first time had been accidental.
News of the misconduct first resurfaced when two female members of parliament had reported Parish claiming they had witnessed him firsthand watching pornography during a parliamentary session, according to converging news reports.
After news of the scandal first emerged, the Conservative Party announced suspending Parish’s membership on Friday.
On his part, Parish said that he would continue working as an independent lawmaker, and that he would cooperate fully with any investigation into his misconduct.
Parish represented the Tiverton and Honiton constituency in southwest England. His resignation means that citizens of the constituency will head to the pools early to elect a new representative.
The lawmakers’ fall from grace did not stop some from publicly endorsing his decision.
A politician from the Tiverton and Honiton Conservatives came out publicly to support Parish, thanking him for the 12 years of service he had rendered to the British public.
""We support his decision to step down as our Member of Parliament,"" the spokesperson told reporters.
Neil Parish had represented Tiverton and Honiton since 2010. He served as a member of the European Parliament for South West England between 1999 to 2009.

Moroccan state news agency MAP reported that the agreement is an integral part of both countries’ commitment to fighting against crime in all its forms, especially including attacks on the life and physical integrity of persons.
The cooperation also seeks to halt arbitrary detention, kidnapping, offenses against property, drug trafficking, as well as human trafficking, and irregular migration.
The agreement is also a commitment from Morocco and Spain to counter the sexual exploitation of children, as well as the production, distribution, or possession of pornographic material involving children.
Other goals of the cooperation agreement include countering extortion, theft, trafficking, and illegal trade in arms, ammunition, explosives, as well as other dangerous substances and money laundering.
The Morocco- Spain agreement is part of the two neighbors’ determination to strengthen cooperation in all fields, particularly the fight against organized crimes.
The agreement also aims to protect the cultural assets of both countries from crime, such as illegal trafficking of artwork and cultural objects.
The agreement between the two countries entered into force as both Rabat and Madrid have been renewing their determination to work together in all fields.
Relations between the two countries have seen signs of considerable improvement in recent weeks after Spain changed its position on the Western Sahara dispute.
On March 18, Spain officially endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara.
Madrid’s new position ended a year-long diplomatic crisis that erupted between the two countries after Spain’s decision to host Polisario leader Brahim Ghali for hospitalization in April 2021.
Appearing determined to “open a new chapter” in their relationship, Morocco and Spain have in the past few days vowed to continue to strengthen their ties and maintain transparency, and mutual respect as key elements to preserving their diplomatic relations.

The closure extension is to “finalize the final details in preparation for the reopening of the borders,” and to ensure the most orderly passage through the borders possible, according to Spain’s Ministry of the Interior.
The ministry also said it reinforced police forces in both enclaves, in an effort to combat irregular migration.
The reopening of the borders was planned for Saturday, April 30.
Borders have been closed since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recent improvement in diplomatic relations between Spain and Morocco suggests the reopening will take place sooner rather than later.
Activists in the two Spanish enclaves have also been calling on authorities to open the border and facilitate the movement of Moroccans in and out of the enclaves. Thousands of Moroccan nationals have also reported being stuck inside the territories and unable to leave.
Following a year of diplomatic tensions, Spain’s relations with Morocco have taken a positive turn again recently following Madrid’s voicing of its support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara.
The improving Madrid-Rabat relationship is widely expected to be marked by  greater cooperation on border security and irregular migration, as well as a reopening of borders.
Ceuta and Melilla are popular destinations for sub-Saharan and Moroccan immigrants attempting to make it to Europe, and Morocco’s security authorities have in recent years collaborated with their Spanish counterparts to halt migration attempts.

72,France Faces ‘Sophie’s Choice’ in Second Macron VS Le Pen Showdown,Many have branded today’s vote as a choice between the largely failed presidency of Macron and the far more disastrous alternative of a far-right presidency.,Aya Benazizi,"Apr. 24, 2022 1:51 p.m.","Casablanca - In the 2022 presidential runoff, French voters are casting their ballot to choose between centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron and far-right politician Marine Le Pen.
While Macron easily defeated the far-right politician Le Pen in the 2017 presidential race, opinion surveys show Macron with a strong lead. However, analysts have warned that poor turnout might shift the vote in any direction.
Although Macron's popularity has dipped since 2017, the war in Ukraine has bolstered his prospects of re-election, particularly in light of Russia's renewed onslaught in the east and the widespread perception of Le Pen as a poster child of right-wing Putinism.
Because purchasing power and security are the two main issues that this election has been contested over, Marine Le Pen's tenacious focus on inflation and the cost of living has considerably improved her standing with French voters in this year’s electoral showdown. 
Macron won by a landslide when he confronted Le Pen in the second round of the 2017 elections. This time round, however, most observers expect a tight contest. 
According to Telegraph polling, Macron is now leading by five percentage points, with 52% of the surveyed planning to vote for the centrist incumbent. But since turnout is critical to securing victory, and with the initial vote results, analysts have warned that Macron’s camp must not take anything for granted.
Le Pen, on the other hand, is swiftly catching up. After trailing by more than 20 points less than a month ago, she is currently polling significantly higher than she did in her face-off with Macron five years ago.
The National Rally (former National Front) candidate has notably managed to boost her first-round vote share -- slightly higher than at the same time for the first round two weeks ago -- to 23.4% (becoming 26.41% at noon on Sunday), garnering the most votes in 39 of France's 95 mainland regions, according to the French Interior Ministry.
Still, many expect Macron to win today’s showdown by a thin margin. 
Le Pen has indubitably fared better in this year’s electoral contest. But the seemingly prevailing perception is that the majority of French people -- especially those from minority groups -- see today’s vote as a choice between the largely failed, underwhelming presidency of Macron and the far more disastrous alternative of a far-right presidency. 
This means French voters are now facing a sort of “Sophine’s choice” as they choose between an aloof and condescending incumbent who has not kept his promises, and a far-right alternative that many fear will be far worse and much more devastating for France and its standing on the global stage.
Leftist journalist Edwy Plenel has spoken of the“sorrow” that many French voters, himself included, will be facing today as they opt for the “Macron ballot paper to vote against Le Pen in order to ward off the catastrophe and horror that will take hold of us if” the far-right candidate is elected. But, he added, “This is about voting against her [Le Pen], and certainly not for him [Macron].”

During yesterday’s emergency meeting of Arab ministers in Amman, Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita stressed his country’s condemnation of the attacks against worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque. 
Bourita informed ministers that following the recent incidents in Jerusalem, the Charge d’Affaires of the Israeli Liaison Office in Rabat had been summoned under the instruction of King Mohammed VI, the Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, highlighting that Al-Aqsa Mosque attacks are abhorrent and must be halted for the sake of peace and stability.
Morocco summoned the Israeli representative in order to reiterate its position and the country’s condemnation of the violation of the mosque’s sanctity and worshippers’ safety, amid ongoing attacks against Palestinians in Al-Aqsa compound on Thursday morning during which hundreds of worshippers have been injured and detained.
The meeting’s aim was to agree on an approach to de-escalating current tensions and to push for international action to combat anti-Palestinian violence and the destruction of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem.
Tensions have risen in Palestine in recent weeks, escalating this week with waves of bloodshed and Israeli soldiers storming Al-Aqsa Mosque over five consecutive days.
As part of the pattern of violence against Palestinians, Israeli police stormed Al Aqsa mosque and attacked worshippers on Friday morning, injuring 30 Palestinians. 
Bourita emphasized that this series of acts at Al-Quds Al-Sharif and Al-Aqsa Mosque is “contrary to international law and international legitimacy in the occupied Palestinian territories,” and a clear provocation to all Arabs and Muslims, which may in turn incite extremist tension and lead to an escalation of violence across the region.
Morocco has repeatedly condemned the attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque and calls on the international community to step in. Despite its new diplomatic ties with Israel, Morocco has always strongly opposed anti-Palestinian violence and considers the Palestinian cause a top priority for regional safety.

Mahamat said in a press release from earlier this week that the actions of Israeli security forces violate international law and will further escalate the situation in the already turbulent region. 
This escalation - including Gaza bombardments - will jeopardize the efforts toward creating a “just and lasting solution” to the conflict, he added.
The AUC’s chairperson reaffirmed the Union’s support for the Palestinian cause. The African Union wants to help the Palestinian people to have “an independent and sovereign State with East Jerusalem as [its] capital.”
Mahamat is calling for international efforts to find a solution to the conflict that is based on the existence of Israel and Palestine, within the framework of the AU and United Nations.
Attacks on Al-Aqsa mosque
Attacks on the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem have intensified during the holy month of Ramadan.
The Israeli Security Forces carried out raids on the Al-Aqsa mosque during morning prayers on April 15. They used tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound bullets. The Israeli forces injured at least 150 Palestinians and arrested hundreds more, reported the BBC on the same day.
According to Al-Jazeera, the Israeli forces injured more than 20 Palestinians in several incidents around the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on April 18. This brings the number of injured since April 15 to more than 170.
In a communique on April 16, Morocco’s foreign ministry condemned continued raids on the Al-Aqsa mosque and the surrounding areas.

Over the three-day event, Moroccan and Mauritanian officials agreed to cooperate on regional issues such as the Palestinian cause, the Libyan crisis, the Western Sahara dispute, and instability in the Sahel. 
They further called for reinforcing cooperation in numerous sectors including agriculture, fishing, trade, tourism, education, and vocational training. 
In September, the Moroccan and Mauritanian foreign ministers concretized their pledge to cement bilateral relations by launching the construction of a Mauritanian diplomatic complex in Rabat. 
Marking the occasion, Morocco’s FM Nasser Bourita said that Rabat and Nouakchott share “special and incomparable” ties, noting his country’s interest in developing “stronger, more consequential economic cooperation” with Mauritania.

During a meeting in Oman, the Arab ministerial commission in charge of deterring illegal Israeli policies and measures in the city of Jerusalem was in the process of issuing a statement that refers to the role Morocco’s King Mohamed VI is playing in promoting the Palestinian cause.
When the Algerian representative noticed the paragraph acknowledging Morocco, he interjected to call for the commission to include a second paragraph highlighting the Algerian president’s contribution to the cause. The commission paid no heed to his demand, according to a report from Morocco’s press agency (MAP).
With the exception of Algeria, all representatives unanimously approved the statement that acknowledged King Mohamed VI's contribution as chairman of the Quds (Jerusalem) commission.
Facing the rejection of all attendees, Algeria announced it would not adopt the statement, leading to Algerian news outlets not mentioning the news.
The paragraph Algeria protests is the following: The commission calls for “endorsing and boosting Arab and Islamic institutional efforts aiming to support Quds (Jerusalem) and its inhabitants, including the Quds commission and the ‘Bayt Mal Al-Quds’ chaired by King Mohammed VI.”
‘Bayt Mal Al-Quds’ is a Moroccan charity dedicated to providing financial support to the Quds city and its inhabitants.
This is not the first time Algeria refuses and attempts to stop other countries from acknowledging Morocco’s efforts in promoting the Palestinian cause.
At an OIC summit in New York last week, Algeria's Permanent Representative to the UN Mohamed Ennadi Larbaoui refused to adopt a press release on the Israeli attack on Al-Aqsa mosque, as it acknowledged the Moroccan monarch’s commitment to the cause.  
While Morocco joined other counties in adopting the press release, Algeria maintained its stance, demanding the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) acknowledge the Algerian president instead.
Morocco’s Permanent Representative to the UN Omar Hilale, expressed Morocco’s dissatisfaction with Algeria’s stance, saying that it is unethical for state representatives in New York to oppose such measures.
The Moroccan official further pointed out that Algeria did not oppose the acknowledgment in which the above committee had paid tribute to King Mohammed VI in March.
Morocco funds 86% of the Bayt Mal Al-Quds Agency, which mobilizes aid for Palestinians. King Mohammed VI chairs the agency. 
Algeria barely ever contributes to the financing of the agency, Hilale said while answering Algeria’s call for acknowledgment.
Hilale, however, did not oppose calls to highlight Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi’s role in supporting the Palestinian cause through numerous actions.

When thinking of diplomacy, one rarely thinks of training religious scholars, welcoming students or building factories, yet Morocco’s holistic approach to diplomacy involves all of these things, and much more.
Morocco’s geographical location, recent developmental success and multicultural history position the country as a possible new thought-leader in Africa, and a hub for regional development and cooperation. 
While other countries in the diplomatic arena possess greater economic riches to sway opinion, or more extensive military support in times of crisis, Rabat offers its partners an altogether different proposal; one of mutual sharing, understanding and cooperation.
The diplomatic successes booked by Moroccan diplomats since its return to the African Union in 2017 have puzzled many, and angered some who see Algeria’s diplomatic clout wane. Morocco is making friends fast, and continues to highlight the importance of South-South cooperation, shared religious values and the exchange of vital technology and knowledge to make African countries more resilient.
Win-win cooperation
Africa in many ways still functions as a colonial export region for Europe and the US, as renowned pan-Africanist and former Director of Kenya’s Anti-Corruption Commission PLO Lumumba often likes to remind his audiences. 
The UN’s trade agency highlights that only 15.4% of African trade happens between African countries, meaning that the remaining 84.6% of trade occurs with foreign partners, often the country’s former colonial master(s). This trend is visible in Rabat and Casablanca, as Moroccan exports focus primarily on Spain and France. 
Breaking this harmful trend is only possible through genuine efforts to promote intra-African trade, not just on ideals but on practical merits. The complementary nature of many of the continent’s resources, like Moroccan phosphates and Algerian gas, are often turned into value-added products in foreign factories, where the real profit is made. 
The solution to these lingering issues that cripple Africa is the oft-touted “South-South cooperation” initiative, which the UN defines as a “manifestation of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South.” Yet despite this concept’s lofty ideals, South-South cooperation has often been more of a rhetorical ploy than a practical matter that is prioritized.
Morocco is attempting to change this status quo by making its South-South approach a fundamental element in its diplomatic efforts. Mutually-beneficial trade and development efforts have been central to Morocco’s diplomatic momentum, from the exchange of scholarships and technology, to the very practical business of building fertilizer plants across the continent.
Supporting Africa’s struggling agricultural sector has been the ace in Morocco’s deck. Home to over 70% of the world’s known phosphate reserves, Morocco has used its natural riches as a means to create value-added products at home, and deploy its profits to develop African innovation and knowledge-building. 
As an example, combining Moroccan phosphates with Nigerian or Ethiopian natural gas helps local economies and spreads state-of-the-art farming practices while supporting farmers and creating sustainable growth and vital food-security.
The COVID-19 crisis appears to have created a new realization in Africa. Many people are now fully aware that when things get tough, you cannot rely on others to save you. 
The few countries that made independent trade deals with China to procure vaccines are some of the highest-vaccinated countries on the continent. Those who waited for Western donations are some of the world’s least vaccinated.
Africa has all the potential to be a fully self-sustainable continent, and Morocco is clearly trying to do its part in making this a reality.
Trade in resources and knowledge
On April 19, Morocco provided further evidence of its South-South orientation as a priority when it ratified its membership in the African Continental Free-Trade Area Treaty (AfCFTA). The continental free trade agreement holds much promise, yet faces significant obstacles as well.Lingering inequalities in development and technology provide a stumbling block against the promise of African economic integration. The exchange of knowledge often still moves from the more advanced global north to Africa in a paternalistic and one-sided manner. Africa’s brightest minds travel the opposite direction, creating the vicious cycle of Africa’s severe brain-drain.
The genuine exchange of vital knowledge and technology among equals appears to be one of the few available solutions to break this disastrous cycle. Especially in regard to African agriculture, the problem is not barren soils, but the lack of technology and innovation that is holding back local food security and development. Having large swaths of the people preoccupied with farming limits the talent pool, and reduces the urgent need to develop service industry jobs that are future-proof and earn a good wage.
Shared knowledge building and academic independence forms a strong foundation on which to promote intra-african trade of complementary resources and African value-added production. 
The African soil contains all the resources to produce smartphones, electric cars or space technology, yet there are no major African businesses innovating in these fields. African mines sent raw material to China and the West, to then see them return in the form of the gadgets Africans depend on for their telecommunications. 
Just as in every developed country's journey, Africa needs to first maximize its agricultural output while minimizing the human and natural resources required to produce food. Morocco appears well-positioned to accelerate this important first step through its vast knowledge exchange programs, often promoted by its largest company OCP Group.
Cultural & Religious influence
Along with economic investments and promoting South-South cooperation, Morocco has adopted a uniquely religious diplomacy in West Africa to expand its sphere of influence and counter rising radical religious discourses. 
West Africa is home to 190 million Muslims from Mauritania, Senegal and Ivory Coast, with Islamic majorities in countries reaching all the way to Somalia in the East.  
Some of these populations follow the Sunni Tijanniyah Sufi brotherhood. With one of its holy sites in Fez, the order has provided Morocco with political and public support in West Africa. 
King Mohammed VI’s status as Amir Al-Mumunin, (commander of the faithful) further legitimizes the Moroccan ruling system and the country’s soft power in the continent in the eyes of West Africans. 
Faced with competition from Saudi-backed Wahhabism and Iran-backed Shi’ism, Morocco has developed two religious and pan-African institutions, the Mohammed VI Institute for training Imams and the Mohammed VI Foundation for African Ulema 
The institutions have promoted moderate and tolerant Maliki Islam by organizing cultural and religious pan-African events, training of African religious scholars, and establishing mosques and Islamic centers across the continent. 
Morocco’s exportation of moderate Islam extends to Europe as the country cooperates with European institutions to counter religious extremist discourses and dismantle radicalized organizations. 
Holistic approach, practical results
While the Moroccan diplomatic approach is built on abstract concepts such as tradition, culture and mutual respect, its effects meanwhile are having a practical impact on the lives of people across the African continent.
While Morocco benefits from the religious status of its monarch, it simultaneously is helping to build vital fertilizer factories, train local farmers, and boost economies through trade. This blend of cultural and historic elements mixed with technological and academic advancements provides a power tool to enable productive cooperation and dialogue to occur.
Trust has been built through the flexibility and neutrality that Moroccan diplomats have shown during crises from Libya and Ukraine, to Mali and Burkina Faso. While Morocco insists on others to respect its pre-colonial borders in the south, it equally demands respect for the territorial integrity and political stability of others.
In a time of hardened minds and inflexible positions, Morocco is showing equal respect to geopolitical giants such as the US and China, it balances its own people’s vital interests in the approach to the Ukraine conflict, while building positive momentum toward resolving the Western Sahara dispute. Not an easy task to accomplish.
Morocco’s abundance of strategic diplomatic tools are welcomed by potential partners because of their sustainable nature. Morocco’s religious significance to millions of Muslims abroad is set in stone, its reserves of phosphates eclypse any other countries’ and its trade agreements reach across the globe.
The things that have made Morocco’s diplomatic efforts produce results are only set to become more relevant in our uncertain future. One thing is certain, with climate change worsening and conflict grabbing headlines, Morocco is trying to do its part to mitigate harm and produce a more prosperous future for itself and its vast network of partners.

78,Spain FM Jose Manuel Albares To Visit Morocco on May 11,"In addition to Albares, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also expected to take part in the high-level event on counterterrorism.",Safaa Kasraoui,"Apr. 21, 2022 3:01 p.m.","Rabat - Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Albares is expected to travel to Morocco on May 11 to take part in the ministerial meeting of the Global Coalition Against ISIS in Marrakech.
Europa Press quoted diplomatic sources confirming Albares’ participation in the event. However, the sources said that it is still not confirmed whether the Spanish FM will hold a bilateral meeting with Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita on the sidelines of the event. 
Albares visited Morocco along with Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Sanchez arrived in Morocco last month following an invitation from King Mohammed VI. 
The invitation followed Spain’s official endorsement of Morrocco’s Autonomy Plan as the best way to resolve the Western Sahara dispute.
In May, diplomats and representatives from over 80 countries are expected to attend the high-level meeting.
In addition to Albares, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also expected to take part in the Global Coalition against Daesh. The visit to Morocco will be the second of its kind for Blinken as a Secretary of State. Blinken arrived in Morocco on March 28, when he held talks with senior Moroccan officials.
During the visit, Blinekn reiterated the US’ satisfaction with Morocco’s efforts and contribution to regional security and stability as well as its commitment against ISIS and other terror organizations.
Morocco is among the countries that contribute to peacekeeping, regional security, and stability against the terror scourge.
The North African country has been intensifying efforts against ISIS and other terror groups, calling for shared responsibility and vigilance to tackle terrorism.
The recent Global Terrorism Index 2022 commended Morocco’s efforts against terrorism, listing it among the world’s safest countries.
“Morocco’s active role in fighting terrorism suggests the country’s understanding of the threat; the interconnectedness of its counterterrorism methods,” the index said.

79,EJOLT: The ‘Environmental Justice’ NGO Doing Separatism’s Bidding in Western Sahara,"While posing as a climate justice platform, EJOLT’s actual aim seems to be to provide an invaluable service to Algeria and the Polisario’s shared battle to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity.",Staff Writer,"Apr. 21, 2022 1:05 p.m.","Rabat - In April this year, a new study titled “Reporting International Conflicts through the Environmental Discourse: The Moroccan Sahara Conflict as a Case Study” was published by Dr. Mohamed Mliless, an independent researcher in Ecolinguistics, and Dr. Mohammed Larouz, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities in Meknes. The study has since been published in a recently issued collective book under the title “The Climate-Conflict- Displacement Nexus from a Human Security Perspective.” 
The promotion of environmental justice (EJ) has been a central concern of international NGOs to reinforce environmental equity worldwide. But this does not seem to be the case with the Environmental Justice Organizations Liabilities and Trade (EJOLT), whose approach distorts the real picture in the Moroccan Sahara. 
Being an EJ impact assessment tool, EJOLT is one of the most prominent mapping Atlas which identifies. Typically, Its work entails describing and assessing thousands of hazardous sites in the world, among which 18 are located in Morocco. 
Disinvestment campaign masquerading as climate justice
In the Western Sahara region, however, EJOLT’s work goes beyond its self-description as an environmental justice crusader to actively embrace the Polisario Front’s Algeria-backed separatist discourse. As such, Mliless and Larouz’s study has shown, the NGO’s separatism-leaning political orientation in the region is the main reason why it has consistently been opposing industrial and energy projects in Morocco’s southern provinces. 
The discourse used by EJOLT to describe EJ issues in the provinces is a pure harassment and an explicit disinvestment plan it pursues to implement a separatist and anarchist agenda in this particular region.  
To argue for this position, the EJOLT prefers taking a pro-Polisario disinvestment stand in the region, which includes conflating environmental justice with the separatist Polisario Front’s quest to benefit from the southern provinces’ “disputed resources.” To demystify such a discourse, Mliless and Larouz’s study examines the EJOLT’s homepage and extracts its narratives. 
The investigation revealed that there are six infrastructures targeted by the EJOLT. The analysis also revealed that the EJOLT uses a biased discourse – mostly distorted and defamatory – that failed to provide the real picture of the population in the region. Moreover, the EJOLT argues that the Polisario militia which lives on Algerian territory, NOT the Moroccan population living in the Moroccan Sahara provinces, must benefit from the existing resources. 
Similarly, the rhetoric used in EJOLT’s campaigning has long failed to recognize that one million inhabitants inside the Moroccan Sahara have been directly benefiting from the many projects developed in the region. Equally important, the results of Mliless and Larouz’s study show that EJOLT’s discourse aims at triggering violence, insecurity, and instability in the region, thus serving potential interested agendas.
Furthermore, the research explains how EJOLT’s narratives promote insecurity and nourish violence given the fact that the forms of mobilization prescribed by the EJOLT to call for EJ activism are fueled 
with hatred, defamation, and violence. Analyzing EJOLT’s online platform, the research located 18 mining, fishing, and energy locations in Moroccan among which six have been mapped in the Moroccan Sahara provinces. 
Through its platform, EJOLT seems to provide an invaluable service to Algeria and the Polisario by launching a viral battle to reinforce boycotts of phosphate, fishery, and renewable energy products from being extracted and exported to foreign markets. Is this about environmental justice or disinvestment?
                                                                        EJOLT’s identified infrastructures in Morocco. (Source: ejatlas.org)
In Morocco, EJOLT has identified 18 environmental conflicts and EJ projects, among which six infrastructures (mineral, energy, and fishery) are located in the Moroccan Sahara. To describe these plants, Mliless and Larouz argue that EJOLT relied on biased documents that were furnished by Algeria and international NGOs which support the separatist ideology in the region. 
The main point here is that the EJOLT’s discourse has been developed based on non-reliable documents. This is clear in the narratives which fail to provide an adjacent and endangered population that complains from the environmental impacts and risks – such as intoxication and pollution – resulting from the assessed projects.

Sustaining separatism and instability
Another main argument in the study is that the EJOLT’s discourse is not in line with the EJ objectives. The linguistic qualifications prove that the EJOLT’s discourse towards Morocco’s Sahara provinces is against the development of the region and the wellbeing of the communities living there. In other words, EJOLT’s discourse falls beyond the limits of EJ as it embraces a radical and violent stand whose ultimate aim is to serve the political agendas of both Algeria and the Polisario Front.
First, EJOLT’s rhetoric does not provide a locally affected community. Second, the NGO’s discourse is politically oriented since its allegations against Moroccan interests are built on inputs provided by the Polisario Front and pro-separatist international NGOs like the Western Sahara Resource Watch (WSRW) located in Belgium. Third, EJOLT’s narratives are supporting separatism, thus nourishing insecurity and instability in the Moroccan Sahara by prescribing radical and destructive forms of protestation. 
As a result, EJOLT has unfortunately turned into a tool to execute a political agenda that Algeria and the Polisario Front have set to counter the development of the region and undermine the equal sharing of wealth among the local population in Morocco’s southern provinces.  The radical forms of mobilization to block and ban products originating from Morocco’s Sahara provinces are perceived in this research as explicit instigations to violence and insecurity in the region.  
On the mobilization front, Mliless and Larouz’s research also reveals two main categories of expressions that EJOLT uses to push the pro-Polisario activists -- both inside the southern provinces and around the world -- to undertake radical forms of mobilization to counter introspection, exploitation, and trade of products originating from Western Sahara. Determined to counter the development process of the Sahara territories, the Polisario Front has been offensively attacking Morocco on legal and judicial levels. 
As well as these battlegrounds, the study concludes that the discourse of the EJOLT is inscribed within this process of undermining the territorial integrity of Morocco, propagating a disinvestment plan in the region, and creating an atmosphere of violence and instability by nourishing arson and chaos. For this aim, EJOLT recommends the following modus operandi in order to stop what it pretends to be “unequal exploitation of the natural resources in the region:”
• Arson
• Sabotage
• Property damage
• Self-immolation
• Hunger strikes
• Occupation of buildings/public spaces
• Land occupation
• Public campaigns
• Public strikes/campaigns/ marches
• Development of a network/collective action
• Media-based activism/alternative media
• Official complaint letters and petitions
• Shareholder/financial activism
• Boycotts of companies-products
• Lawsuits/ Court cases/ judicial activism
As such, the study points to a marked drift in the notion of EJ as claimed by EJOLT towards the projects in the Moroccan southern provinces. This drift -- EJOLT’s instrumentalization of climate justice to benefit a political agenda -- besmirches the NGO’s credibility as a tool that genuinely fights against environmental inequalities in the world. In fact, EJOLT has consistently drifted or failed its EJ ambitions when it comes to providing services to an immediate locally impacted population, a core principle of climate activism. 
Interestingly, such a failure to commit to an essential tenet of environmental activism is strongly related to EJOLT’s inability to build on neutral and diversified resources. Instead, the obviously biased NGO’s narratives sound like a Polisario Front discourse that can hardly bring operational solutions to the issue of environmental quality and equity.

80,Arab League Commends Morocco’s Position on Israeli Attacks on Al Aqsa,"Morocco informed Israeli representatives in Rabat of its strong opposition to the recent attacks on Al Aqsa, warning that such acts would result in hatred and extremism.",Safaa Kasraoui,"Apr. 21, 2022 12:58 p.m.","Rabat - The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, commended Morocco’s position against the recent Israeli attacks on the Al Aqsa mosque.
The secretary-general also recalled the importance of the recent call between King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II of Jordan, during which the two sovereigns discussed the developments at the Jerusalem mosque.
Al Aqsa Mosque has been witnessing continued violent attacks from Israeli troops, who have been storming the holy site -- injuring dozens of Palestinians.
Abou Gheit cited Morocco’s and Jordan’s firm positions against the attacks in a report to the emergency meeting of the Arab Ministerial Committee, in charge of international action to confront illegal Israeli policies in the occupied city of Jerusalem. The emergency meeting is taking place today in Amman.
The report mentioned the recent call between the King of Morocco and the King of Jordan, who both argued that the Israeli escalation would increase “feelings of hatred, extremism, and would destroy the chances of reviving the peace process in the region.”
Abou Gheit also cited Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs' recent communique, in which it strongly condemned and denounced Israeli actions in Al Aqsa.
In the communique, the Moroccan ministry said it  “strongly condemns and denounces the Israeli invasion of Al-Aqsa mosque, the closing of its gates, and assault on worshippers inside the mosque and in the  courtyards.”
Morocco views the Israeli attacks on Al Aqsa as a blatant violation of human rights and methodical provocation, especially considering that it happened during the month of Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims.
Under King Mohammed VI’s instruction, the Moroccan ministry informed Israeli representatives in Rabat about the country’s position on the attacks.
Earlier this week, Palestinian ambassador to Rabat Jamal Al Shobaki extended his country's gratitude to Morocco for its position against Israel’s recent attacks on Al Aqsa mosque.
He said that Morocco’s “condemnation of the recent Israeli attacks against worshipers in Al-Aqsa Mosque and [on] the rest of the Palestinian people in the various Palestinian regions is in line with the Arab and Islamic position in general.”

81,How Morocco's Multi-Faceted Diplomatic Approach in Africa is Winning,"In a tough geopolitical context, Morocco’s unique approach to diplomacy is winning hearts and minds on the African continent.",Souad Anouar And Jasper Hamann,"Apr. 21, 2022 12:32 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco in many ways cannot compete for diplomatic clout with its larger competitors across the world, yet it holds a few unique cards that are producing results for Rabat. 
West-Africa, and the Sahel region in particular, form some of the most complex geopolitical arenas in the world, save for the Persian Gulf and South-China Sea. Yet, caught in the midst of conflict, famine and migration, Morocco is producing a new model of diplomacy that is both holistic and pragmatic. 
Morocco is facing the same threats as its southern neighbors. Climate-change, economic fragility and political instability are a shared threat to the safety and prosperity of us all, and create a unique bond between affected countries that transcends the traditional paternalistic development aid model where rich countries “aid” the poor. 
The North African country is making new friends and solidifying old relationships through its unique blend of diplomacy based on existing cultural, historic and religious ties, as well as a shared need for rapid advancement, development and knowledge-building. 
Morocco’s approach is working, and it's working in one of the toughest geopolitical contexts on the planet.
Instability as the norm
The Sahel region is uniquely impacted by the reality of global trends, from religious extremism to water scarcity. Caught in the storm of international finance, irregular warfare and the evolving climate crisis, the Sahel is one of the most tumultuous regions in the world.
From Mauritania to Eritrea, weak political and economic institutions have created a power vacuum that favors jihadist groups, exploitative industry and power-hungry military commanders looking to exploit structural weaknesses in African countries.
Food insecurity, famine, and water scarcity are current signs of more hardships to come. Population growth and youth unemployment, combined with rising temperatures and more frequent natural disasters is putting more pressure on the resources of North Africa and the Sahel. 
To tackle these emerging issues, some countries including Morocco are resorting to reducing greenhouse gasses, producing green energy, and investing in desalination. 
However, these projects require heavy and long-term investments that remain unachievable for most of the region’s vulnerable economies. 
Meanwhile the region, and North Africa as a whole, is facing new emerging threats originating from outside forces. A key example of regional fragility is the current disruption of supply chains by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which threatens food supplies in the region. 
Faced with economic and environmental crises, many on the youthful continent are resorting to northward migration for employment opportunities and better living conditions. In such a context, North African governments operate as gatekeepers for Europe. 
Morocco’s diplomatic momentum
In a region marked by instability, productive diplomacy is often swept aside in the name of short-term pragmatism in response to crises. Yet, in West-Africa, a positive diplomatic trend has emerged over the past decade that bucks this trend of short-term thinking, and is creating new hope for future cooperation and development.
The trend in question comes from Morocco’s decades-old efforts to create a diplomatic consensus on the Western Sahara dispute, creating momentum that has swelled ever since Morocco rejoined the African Union in 2017. The emergence of a new coalition of like-minded countries can finally serve as a basis for peace and a mutually acceptable solution to this lingering geopolitical sore undermining regional stability. 
Through intense diplomatic efforts and development cooperation, Morocco has welcomed a variety of African countries to open consulates in Dakhla and Laayoune. 
These buildings symbolize a new consensus on dialogue and cooperation as the solution for the Sahara dispute. That consensus extends beyond Africa, with several Caribbean and Arab nations establishing brick-and-mortar examples of their support for Morocco’s efforts to resolve the dispute. 
With the US and Spain now firmly and officially on Morocco’s side of the Sahara dossier, the dominos in the West are similarly falling in favor of pragmatism and with a renewed will to resolve the three-decade old conflict that has divided the region. The diplomatic push-and-pull between rivals Morocco and Algeria is tipping in Rabat’s favor, to the benefit of regional peace.
International players
As Moroccan diplomatic gains accumulate, the country’s sphere of influence in North Africa and Sahel overlaps with the interests of regional actors such as neighboring Algeria and international powers including the United States and Western European countries including France and Spain.  
With the French presence and popularity in the region waning, Spain has been eager to consolidate ties with the neighboring continent to address pressing issues such irregular migration and security while building new trade ties. 
Italy also expressed willingness to reinvigorate its position in the Mediterranean by strengthening its stand on the Libyan crisis.
Rising tensions with Algeria threaten to undermine Morocco’s growing network of diplomatic and trade relations in Africa. Yet Morocco has successfully secured and consolidated relations with the United States and Europe through establishing diplomatic, security, and economic cooperation. These ties back Morocco’s leadership position in the region, and Algeria’s waning diplomatic and economic clout. 
However the latest European energy crisis induced by the war in Ukraine could again tip the balance in Algeria’s favor, with the US and Spain negotiating an increase in Algerian natural gas supply to Europe. Still, Algiers’ hostile stance towards Morocco appears to be undermining its reputation as a reliable supplier of hydrocarbon products.
With the downfall of ISIS in the Levant, American, European, and Maghrebi decision-makers and security experts have dedicated more attention to the unstable region of Sahel.
Global impact
The strategic and resource-rich region remains a major concern for regional and international stability, especially given its proximity to Europe. The presence of Daesh, Al Qaeda-affiliated groups and other extremists have undermined the legitimacy of central governments and provided a pass for foreign intervention in the region. 
For years, foreign interventions in the Sahel have fueled political and social unrest, leading to the deepening of the power vacuum and an increase in arms flow from post-Gaddafi Libya that supports irregular warfare and criminal activities. Meanwhile the structural issues of lingering poverty, a lack of opportunities for youth and regional power struggles cannot be resolved by foreign military interventions
Coups d’etats in Burkina Faso and Mali are perfect examples of people revolting against governments unable to deal with their most pressing issues, yet the question arises: What better alternative exists in a region “bounded” by foreign intervention and instability? 
In such a context, Morocco tries to provide a comprehensive alternative. As a former colony of Spain and France, the country remains relatively reliant on diplomatic and economic relations with Europe and the United States, while understanding the mentality and structural issues plaguing formerly-colonized people and their governments. 
However, Morocco’s historical and religious bonds with countries in the Sahel lays the ground for cooperation and mediation in face of religious extremism. 
Unable to invest millions of dollars in military or economic support in the region, Morocco is using its moderate diplomacy to maintain relations with the ruling and rival parties in the region like in Libya and Mali. 
A new era
Over the years, Morocco has built a reputation as a reliable partner and promoter of stability in Africa. With solid cooperation with the United States and European countries, Morocco transcended its sole role as a partner, to aspire to regional leadership. 
Morocco’s ambitions continue to overlap and conflict with the interests of its hostile neighbor Algeria and former colonial powers of France, Spain, and Italy as well as the conflict-driven world order, international finance and foreign business interests.
Unable to match the economic and military power of its competitors, Morocco is using its historical and cultural card of religious diplomacy. Faced with Wahhabism and Shi’ism in Africa, the country mobilizes its religious networks throughout the continent to boost its image as the legitimate frontrunner in Africa, or at least lead Muslim communities in the continent. 
In an era defined by Islamophobia and divisions, Morocco’s diplomatic and economic leadership empowered by moderate Islam is much needed and supported. With the exchange of knowledge and win-win trade deals as their primary weapons, Moroccan diplomats are welcomed in African capitals looking for genuine partners.
Morocco’s vision for Africa stands apart from the centuries-old colonial divide-and-rule mindset and provides an opportunity to reverse the core-and-periphery model. As African countries remain reliant on their former colonial masters and current funders, Morocco aspires for an inclusive, independent, and intellectual Africa.

Several Russian media aired a video showing Russia’s military interrogating the Moroccan man who identified himself as “Brahim Sadun.”
According to RuNews 24, Sadun was reportedly operating in the Ukrainian army under contract. Before the ongoing war broke out, Saudin was studying at the Faculty of Aerodynamic and Space Technologies at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute (KPI). 
RuNews24 quoted Sadun as saying that he was “frightened when he realized that he was being taken as a prisoner.” He added, according to the Russian outlet, that the “most terrible thing was to realize that [he was ] a few meters away from an enemy that he had previously seen through binoculars.”
Morocco World News (MWN) reached out to the Russian embassy in Rabat but could not get any comments at the time of writing.
MWN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video of Sadun’s interrogation.
Tensions have continued to escalate in the Ukraine war as Russia signals the start of a whole new military campaign in eastern Ukraine in the coming days. On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced a “new phase” in the Kyiv-Moscow conflict.
The UN has strongly condemned Russian offenses in Ukraine, appealing for a ceasefire.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has notably urged all parties to “reach an urgent and immediate ceasefire, which will enable the safe and secure functioning of humanitarian corridors.”

83,Abdelilah Benkirane to Government: You Should Resign If You Cannot Resolve Crisis,Benkirane’s statements come in response to Head of Government Akhannouch’s criticism of the PJD’s “failed” decade-long governance.,Safaa Kasraoui,"Apr. 20, 2022 3:11 p.m.","Abdelilah Benkirane, the Secretary General of the opposition Justice and Development Party (PJD), has strongly responded to Morocco’s Head of Government’s latest criticism of the PJD’s “failure” to preempt many of the country’s current crises.
Benkirane, who was Morocco’s head of government from November 2011 to April 2017, hit back at Aziz Akhannouch’s recent remarks in a 30-minute Facebook live.
Akhannouch had accused PJD of mismanaging the energy crisis caused by Algeria’s decision to terminate the contract of the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline. 
Algeria ended the pipeline’s contract in October of last year, accusing Morocco of hostility against its security and stability. The halt of the pipeline contract followed Algeria’s decision to sever diplomatic relations with Morocco in August of last year. 
In comments he made on Monday while responding to a question from a PJD MP, Akhannouch claimed the former ruling party’s “failure” to proactively deal with that episode heralded the energy crisis the current government is now trying to tackle.

He also argued that the PJD’s decade-long governance was largely underwhelming on many fronts, and that the party’s leadership should show more understanding as the current government strives to do what PJD’s governance “could not achieve in ten years.” 
In response to the accusations from the Head of Government, Benkirane described Akhannouch’s remarks as “irresponsible” and “unacceptable.”
“This is an irresponsible statement. It is either something you came up with or it is something that an idiot told you because there are sovereign matters,” Benkirane said.
He cited statements from Morocco’s National Office for Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM), reassuring citizens that Algeria’s decision would have no significant impact on the performance of the national electricity system.
“Are you sure about what you are accusing people of or you are just throwing claims for the sake of it? This is a sensitive statement...you are giving  our enemies’ an opportunity to exploit such remarks,” Benkirane argued.
The PJD’s Secretary General also took issue with Akhannouch’s account of the underlying causes of Morocco’s ongoing economic crisis.
Akhannouch had lashed out at critics of his government’s performances, saying that his cabinet does not have a “magic wand” to resolve all ongoing crises.
“You are asking others to do what you could not do in ten years,” he said on Monday, stressing that PJD is responsible for the increase in fuel prices as Benkirane supported the liberalization of the energy sector when he was head of government.

In response, Benkirane described Akhannouch’s accusation as “unreasonable and inappropriate.” He also accused fuel companies of benefiting from MAD 17 billion “without being held accountable.”
As Akhannouch owns Afriquia, one of Morocco’s leading energy companies, Benkraine said the head of government was among “happiest people” after the liberalization of the energy sector. “What changed now?” Benkirane quipped, ironically recalling Akhannouch’s satisfaction with the PDJ-led government's liberalization of the sector. 
While conceding that Morocco’s energy market was indeed liberalized while PJD was in power,  Benkirane argued that Akahnnouch was in league with energy firms to push for the liberalization and make more profits. He said: “Let us say that it is us who liberalized the energy sector… is it still reasonable to see the government’s role… with whining and crying?”  
In his Monday’s statement, Akahannouch was adamant that the PJD’s resounding failure in last year’s elections was a telling indication of Moroccans’ “disappointment” with the party. But Benkirane hit back at that claim, too, saying: “This is a shame. How dare you brag about securing the majority of  votes?”

84,Morocco’s Offshore Wind Potential Can Meet 17 Times of Its Power Demand,The Strait of Gibraltar and the south of the Atlantic coast provide the best offshore wind potential for Morocco.,Souad Anouar,"June 08, 2022 9:51 a.m.","Rabat - As Morocco aspires to increase its wind capacity by 4.2 GW by 2030, the country’s offshore wind potential is capable of meeting more than 17.3 of its current power demands. 
Despite the absence of set targets for offshore wind in Morocco, the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) reported in its latest report that the country has “vast potential floating offshore wind offers” that can help it cut reliance on fossil fuel - oil, gas, and coal -  and reach Net Zero by 2050. 
Morocco’s offshore wind potential and the government’s “strong” commitment to green energy transition make the country “stand out as a market to watch,” said Maf Smith, Vice-Chair of GWEC’s Floating Offshore Wind Task Force.
As well as having Africa’s biggest wind farm in Tarfaya, the report argues, Morocco has the potential to produce large offshore wind capacity in the Strait of Gibraltar and the south of the Atlantic coast where the average wind speed exceeds 10 meters/second. 
While the abundance of stakeholders and maritime traffic in Gibraltar provides logistical hurdles, the port of Agadir offers a logistic base and access to grid links.

However, investment in the grid infrastructure in Morocco’s southern provinces remains necessary to accommodate the large-scale offshore wind capacity and transport it to load centers in the northern provinces.
Additional investments in new renewable energy technologies must be part of Morocco’s roadmap to ensure the full exploitation of the renewable energy potential, stated Ben Backwell, CEO of GWEC.
Morocco has previously committed to the development of wind capacity through its Integrated Wind Energy Program. Adopted in 2010, the strategy seeks to increase onshore wind capacity by 1 GW by 2024 and by 4.2 GW by 2030 to contribute to the overall renewable energy goals of 52% by the end of the decade.  
Considering the Kingdom’s offshore wind potential, GWEC reported that Morocco is part of a “chasing pack” of markets that could “drive the new wave of floating wind growth.”  
The pack has a total offshore wind potential of 3861GW and consists of Morocco, Italy, Ireland, the Philippines, and the US Pacific coast. 
Scott Urquhart, Managing Director of Aegir Insights, co-author of the report, said that the five countries that aspire to catch up to global offshore wind leaders such as the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Japan.

Called “FinBot,” the platform is accessible through the simultaneous texting application WhatsApp. The service aims to bring Finea’s product offering closer to customers, the company says.
The chatting service would allow very small businesses and SMEs to access consulting services and information on Finea’s financing solutions, according to the company.
In addition to offering information on the company’s services, the chat box would also serve as a customer service center, available around the clock to give customers reports on their financial situation.
Finea hopes that digitizing its services would minimize the need for customers to go to physical agencies.
The chatting service is accessible through the following link: www.finea.ma/chatbot.
Finea is part of the CDG Group, a state-owned company in charge of managing Morocccans’ long-term savings. 
The agency’s primary role is to serve Morocco’s underbanked and unbanked businesses and to promote financial inclusion.
In 2019, Finea issued MAD 863 million ($87.4 million) in financing for Moroccan businesses, supporting more than 778 very small, small, and medium-sized businesses, with the average loan per company standing at MAD 1,100 million ($111.4 million).
In recent months, Morocco has been ramping up efforts to digitize public service in a bid to render the public sector more efficient and transparent.
This month, the government announced ambitious plans to digitize all public administrative services by 2030.
According to official sources, the country has already adopted several programs to facilitate the transition into fully digitized public administrative services.

The report, published on June 6, notes that the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis have accelerated the need for digital solutions in the financial and social sectors. 
“To improve their lives and well-being, people need to be able to take care of their finances, health, and ability to participate in the workforce,” said Umar Hashmi, Vice President of Global Product & Engineering at Mastercard. “This is what financial inclusion efforts can and must aim to enable.”
As the Middle East and Africa region struggles to reach financial, health, and education inclusion outside urban hubs, argues the report, there is a clear need for accelerated digital transformation in the region. 
Despite accumulated challenges, governments and private stakeholders in MEA countries have launched several initiatives to address the financial inclusion gap by facilitating transactions for the unbanked and introducing pay-on-demand business models to make digital services accessible and affordable.

In Morocco, digital inclusion has helped “provide quick and secure financial support to disadvantaged demographics amidst the pandemic,” the Mastercard study found, adding that Moroccan informal workers use their smartphones to receive governmental support “quickly and efficiently.” 
With smartphones facilitating online transactions, the MEA region experienced a notable uptick in smartphone penetration amid the pandemic. Yet the Moroccan penetration rate remains the lowest in the region compared to Jordan, Iraq, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. 
Notably, 75% of the surveyed Moroccans own a smartphone compared to the regional average of 83%, while only 32% of the Moroccan participants acquired one or more smart devices during 2020-2021, 9% shorter than the regional average of 41%.
In contrast, Nigeria has the largest ownership of connected devices (87%), and 62% of the Nigerian participants in the study reported that they purchased one or more smart devices in the past two years.

As for online transactions, only 34% of Moroccans make online transactions compared to the regional average of 55%. 
Regionally, digital transactions are commonly conducted through bank services such as applications (87%) and websites (71%).  Mobile money accounts and digital wallets are also popular channels for digital transactions, followed by apple pay, google pay, and Samsung which are less common - only 32% of the participants reported using these payment options. 
While Moroccan use of online payment remains low, 46% of MEA people use these services to pay for utility bills and receive their salaries. The other uses include sending and receiving money as well as saving or investing. 
Another use of online devices that rose to the spotlight during the pandemic is digital education services. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Moroccan schools were closed fully for 17 weeks and partially for another 17 weeks, which raised the need for digital education services. 
Mastercard’s study notably found that 47% of Moroccans were connected digitally to an education service provider during the pandemic to attend live classes (57%), interact with teachers or students (51%), learn from recorded classes (48%), manage learning schedules (41%), and pay for services (30%), as well as store and refer to progress reports (27%).

90,737 Hotels in Morocco Receive Over $100 Million in Government Support,The funds are part of Morocco’s tourism ministry’s strategy to support the hospitality sector to bounce back from the pandemic-induced recession.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 06, 2022 3:33 p.m.","Rabat - Moroccan Businesses working in the hospitality sector,  including hotels, are now receiving funds from the MAD 2 billion ($202 million) the government has dedicated to supporting the tourism sector.
In the first phase of the program, 373 tourist accommodation establishments, including hotels, have received a total of MAD 1 billion ($101), according to an official press release quoted in a report by the news website Le360.
According to the report, the tourism ministry approved all requests below the MAD 500,000 ($50,700) threshold, in a bid to support small businesses in the Moroccan hospitality industry.
As part of the state-financed program to improve the sector’s product offering, the ministry of tourism said the funds aim to support businesses to invest in the maintenance of equipment and space and accelerate the rate of transitioning to renewable energy. 
In addition to providing businesses with the capital to improve their services, the fund aims to help the tourism sector bounce back post-pandemic, the press release explained.
The tourism ministry allocated 90% of the funds to businesses that were active in the sector at least since 2019, with the remaining 10% of the budget going to special cases of businesses that do not meet the criterion.
In addition, and to encourage small structures, requests for grants of less than 500,000 DH have all been granted, stressed the statement, adding that the ministry initially opened calls for applications for the program in February 2022. 
For regions where requests for grants did not exceed the budget allocated for the region, 100% of requests were approved, the statement pointed out, noting that the second phase of the program will open next July.

91,Only 15% of Morocco’s Rural Areas Have Access to Clean Cooking Solutions,Intoxication from carbon-intensive cooking solutions causes up to four million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 06, 2022 12:01 p.m.","Rabat - Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking remains relatively low in rural areas in Morocco, with only 15% of rural populations having access to clean cooking solutions as of 2020.
Despite increasing by four points between 2015 and 2020, going from 11% to 15%, access to clean cooking solutions in remote areas remains less than half that of urban areas, according to data from the World Bank.
Access to clean cooking solutions in urban areas stood at 69% in 2020, the report indicates.
Published on June 2, the document warns that unless access to clean cooking becomes a priority for governments around the world, over 2.1 billion people will continue to use traditional cooking solutions, including biomass, kerosene, or coal in 2030.
Traditional cooking solutions entail significant environmental, economic as well as health hazards, especially for women and children.
The COVID pandemic did little to help the trend as rising gas prices during the recovery period significantly slowed the process of phasing out charcoal.
Setting aside the environmental impact of traditional cooking solutions, the smoke from these carbon-intensive cooking solutions causes up to 4 million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, according to some estimates.
Commenting on the global progress towards facilitating access to clean cooking solutions, the World Bank’s report notes that it has been overall “slow” due to the pandemic.
The report further indicates that, on a global scale, the number of people who have gained access to clean cooking solutions rose significantly as more than 65 countries adopted clean cooking goals in their national strategies. 
However, population growth has largely dwarfed the progress, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
With the continent’s population increasing significantly, the number of people with constrained access to clean cooking solutions has, as a result, stagnated for decades.

92,Siltation Causes Moroccan Dams to Lose 70 Million Cubic Meters of Water,Siltation poses a significant threat to Morocco’s water resources as it causes national dams to lose a substantial amount of water every year.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 05, 2022 3:22 p.m.","Rabat - Adding to drought, siltation is causing Moroccan dams to lose up to 70 million cubic meters of water every year, putting further strain on the country’s water resources.
While dams were already running way under their full capacity because of this year’s modest rainfall, siltation is further reducing the dams’ reservoirs, an official from Morocco’s dam resources agency (ABHSM) told the news website Le360 in an interview.
“The siltation of dams is a natural phenomenon that appears as a result of soil erosion in different regions of the country,” the official said. “Unfortunately, this causes us to lose large quantities of water every year.”
All dams across Morocco suffer from siltation, with one of the country’s largest dams, the Bouregreg and Chaouia dam, losing as much as 2.5 million cubes of water to the siltation, the official explained. 
To mitigate the effect of siltation on Moroccan dams, he pointed out, the agency has adopted multiple measures including designing dams that could potentially withstand up to 50 years of soil erosion without affecting the dam’s capacity to hold water.
Other techniques the agency has adopted include planting trees and constructing protective dams. 
The measures are expected to reduce the siltation of dams in Morocco by up to 20% by 2050, the official noted.
In April of this year, Moroccan dams were running at 34.3% of their full capacity, down from 50.8% the year before. 
The notable decline in water resources is the result of the severe drought Morocco witnessed at the start of this year.

“President  Putin expressed to us his readiness to facilitate Ukrainian wheat exports,” Sall tweeted following his meeting with the Russian president. “Russia is ready to ensure the export of its wheat and fertilizers. I call on all partners to lift sanctions targeting wheat and fertilizer.”
Putin hosted Sall in his residency at the Black Sea, with the two leaders notably discussing global food shortages and grain supply disruptions, the website News Wire reported.
“I found Vladimir Putin committed and aware that the crisis and sanctions create serious problems for weak economies, such as African economies,” Sall told reporters after the meeting.
The AU official explained that he is “very reassured and very happy” with his exchange with the Russian president.
Prior to the meeting, Sall reportedly drew Putin’s attention to the potential food crisis looming over Africa.
While Africa is geographically distant from the action amid the raging Ukraine war, African “countries are victims on an economic level,” argued the Senegalese president.
He further underscored the importance of keeping food, grain, and fertilizers outside the reach of Western sanctions that had been escalating since the start of Russia’s Ukraine invasion on February 24.
Commenting on the meeting, Putin did not specifically signal out grain supply. However, he said that Russia is on Africa’s side and looks to boost cooperation with the continent.
Since the start of the Ukraine war, the US and the European Union have imposed an unprecedented amount of sanctions on Russia, prompting the country to turn to Africa and Asia.
On the backdrop of the meeting between the AU head and Russian president, Putin’s spokesperson said that the Russian president would explain to Sall the state of affairs concerning grain supplies currently stuck in Ukrainian ports.
The Kremlin spokesperson said that Russia is not blocking shipments.
Since the start of the Ukraine invasion, international organizations have sounded the alarm on the state of global food security. Many have warned that Africa will be hardest hit by the global shortage of grains and fertilizers as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters.

Echoing the trend of production, sales equally fell over the same month across the board, with the exception of the mechanical parts manufacturing and the agri-food industry. Sales have stagnated and increased respectively within the two industries, according to a recent report from Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM).
Building on the results of a monthly survey, Morocco’s central bank concluded that the country’s Capacity Utilization Rate (TUC), a measure of how much a country produces from its overall production capacity, stands at 72%.
While assessing market outlook perception, manufacturers noted that they are optimistic about market recovery for the coming three months. 19% of surveyed businesses said they feel the market is cloaked with uncertainty.
Within the agri-food industry, production increased with the industry running at 67% capacity in April, BAM said.
When asked about the three-month market outlook, professionals within the sector said that they expect an increase in the production capacity while sales would likely remain sluggish, and 40% of professionals said they expect market uncertainty to prevail.
Morocco’s least performing industry in April was the electronics manufacturing industry. The sector was running at 60% production capacity over the month, with sales dropping due to the decline in international demand and stagnation in national demand.
Businesses within the sector said they are less optimistic about market recovery prospects as they feel production and sales would stagnate over the following three months.

Additional investments in new renewable energy technologies must be part of Morocco’s roadmap to ensure the full exploitation of the renewable energy potential, stated Ben Backwell, CEO of GWEC.
Morocco has previously committed to the development of wind capacity through its Integrated Wind Energy Program. Adopted in 2010, the strategy seeks to increase onshore wind capacity by 1 GW by 2024 and by 4.2 GW by 2030 to contribute to the overall renewable energy goals of 52% by the end of the decade.  
Considering the Kingdom’s offshore wind potential, GWEC reported that Morocco is part of a “chasing pack” of markets that could “drive the new wave of floating wind growth.”  
The pack has a total offshore wind potential of 3861GW and consists of Morocco, Italy, Ireland, the Philippines, and the US Pacific coast. 
Scott Urquhart, Managing Director of Aegir Insights, co-author of the report, said that the five countries that aspire to catch up to global offshore wind leaders such as the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Japan.

Called “FinBot,” the platform is accessible through the simultaneous texting application WhatsApp. The service aims to bring Finea’s product offering closer to customers, the company says.
The chatting service would allow very small businesses and SMEs to access consulting services and information on Finea’s financing solutions, according to the company.
In addition to offering information on the company’s services, the chat box would also serve as a customer service center, available around the clock to give customers reports on their financial situation.
Finea hopes that digitizing its services would minimize the need for customers to go to physical agencies.
The chatting service is accessible through the following link: www.finea.ma/chatbot.
Finea is part of the CDG Group, a state-owned company in charge of managing Morocccans’ long-term savings. 
The agency’s primary role is to serve Morocco’s underbanked and unbanked businesses and to promote financial inclusion.
In 2019, Finea issued MAD 863 million ($87.4 million) in financing for Moroccan businesses, supporting more than 778 very small, small, and medium-sized businesses, with the average loan per company standing at MAD 1,100 million ($111.4 million).
In recent months, Morocco has been ramping up efforts to digitize public service in a bid to render the public sector more efficient and transparent.
This month, the government announced ambitious plans to digitize all public administrative services by 2030.
According to official sources, the country has already adopted several programs to facilitate the transition into fully digitized public administrative services.

The report, published on June 6, notes that the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis have accelerated the need for digital solutions in the financial and social sectors. 
“To improve their lives and well-being, people need to be able to take care of their finances, health, and ability to participate in the workforce,” said Umar Hashmi, Vice President of Global Product & Engineering at Mastercard. “This is what financial inclusion efforts can and must aim to enable.”
As the Middle East and Africa region struggles to reach financial, health, and education inclusion outside urban hubs, argues the report, there is a clear need for accelerated digital transformation in the region. 
Despite accumulated challenges, governments and private stakeholders in MEA countries have launched several initiatives to address the financial inclusion gap by facilitating transactions for the unbanked and introducing pay-on-demand business models to make digital services accessible and affordable.

In Morocco, digital inclusion has helped “provide quick and secure financial support to disadvantaged demographics amidst the pandemic,” the Mastercard study found, adding that Moroccan informal workers use their smartphones to receive governmental support “quickly and efficiently.” 
With smartphones facilitating online transactions, the MEA region experienced a notable uptick in smartphone penetration amid the pandemic. Yet the Moroccan penetration rate remains the lowest in the region compared to Jordan, Iraq, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. 
Notably, 75% of the surveyed Moroccans own a smartphone compared to the regional average of 83%, while only 32% of the Moroccan participants acquired one or more smart devices during 2020-2021, 9% shorter than the regional average of 41%.
In contrast, Nigeria has the largest ownership of connected devices (87%), and 62% of the Nigerian participants in the study reported that they purchased one or more smart devices in the past two years.

As for online transactions, only 34% of Moroccans make online transactions compared to the regional average of 55%. 
Regionally, digital transactions are commonly conducted through bank services such as applications (87%) and websites (71%).  Mobile money accounts and digital wallets are also popular channels for digital transactions, followed by apple pay, google pay, and Samsung which are less common - only 32% of the participants reported using these payment options. 
While Moroccan use of online payment remains low, 46% of MEA people use these services to pay for utility bills and receive their salaries. The other uses include sending and receiving money as well as saving or investing. 
Another use of online devices that rose to the spotlight during the pandemic is digital education services. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Moroccan schools were closed fully for 17 weeks and partially for another 17 weeks, which raised the need for digital education services. 
Mastercard’s study notably found that 47% of Moroccans were connected digitally to an education service provider during the pandemic to attend live classes (57%), interact with teachers or students (51%), learn from recorded classes (48%), manage learning schedules (41%), and pay for services (30%), as well as store and refer to progress reports (27%).

102,737 Hotels in Morocco Receive Over $100 Million in Government Support,The funds are part of Morocco’s tourism ministry’s strategy to support the hospitality sector to bounce back from the pandemic-induced recession.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 06, 2022 3:33 p.m.","Rabat - Moroccan Businesses working in the hospitality sector,  including hotels, are now receiving funds from the MAD 2 billion ($202 million) the government has dedicated to supporting the tourism sector.
In the first phase of the program, 373 tourist accommodation establishments, including hotels, have received a total of MAD 1 billion ($101), according to an official press release quoted in a report by the news website Le360.
According to the report, the tourism ministry approved all requests below the MAD 500,000 ($50,700) threshold, in a bid to support small businesses in the Moroccan hospitality industry.
As part of the state-financed program to improve the sector’s product offering, the ministry of tourism said the funds aim to support businesses to invest in the maintenance of equipment and space and accelerate the rate of transitioning to renewable energy. 
In addition to providing businesses with the capital to improve their services, the fund aims to help the tourism sector bounce back post-pandemic, the press release explained.
The tourism ministry allocated 90% of the funds to businesses that were active in the sector at least since 2019, with the remaining 10% of the budget going to special cases of businesses that do not meet the criterion.
In addition, and to encourage small structures, requests for grants of less than 500,000 DH have all been granted, stressed the statement, adding that the ministry initially opened calls for applications for the program in February 2022. 
For regions where requests for grants did not exceed the budget allocated for the region, 100% of requests were approved, the statement pointed out, noting that the second phase of the program will open next July.

103,Only 15% of Morocco’s Rural Areas Have Access to Clean Cooking Solutions,Intoxication from carbon-intensive cooking solutions causes up to four million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 06, 2022 12:01 p.m.","Rabat - Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking remains relatively low in rural areas in Morocco, with only 15% of rural populations having access to clean cooking solutions as of 2020.
Despite increasing by four points between 2015 and 2020, going from 11% to 15%, access to clean cooking solutions in remote areas remains less than half that of urban areas, according to data from the World Bank.
Access to clean cooking solutions in urban areas stood at 69% in 2020, the report indicates.
Published on June 2, the document warns that unless access to clean cooking becomes a priority for governments around the world, over 2.1 billion people will continue to use traditional cooking solutions, including biomass, kerosene, or coal in 2030.
Traditional cooking solutions entail significant environmental, economic as well as health hazards, especially for women and children.
The COVID pandemic did little to help the trend as rising gas prices during the recovery period significantly slowed the process of phasing out charcoal.
Setting aside the environmental impact of traditional cooking solutions, the smoke from these carbon-intensive cooking solutions causes up to 4 million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, according to some estimates.
Commenting on the global progress towards facilitating access to clean cooking solutions, the World Bank’s report notes that it has been overall “slow” due to the pandemic.
The report further indicates that, on a global scale, the number of people who have gained access to clean cooking solutions rose significantly as more than 65 countries adopted clean cooking goals in their national strategies. 
However, population growth has largely dwarfed the progress, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
With the continent’s population increasing significantly, the number of people with constrained access to clean cooking solutions has, as a result, stagnated for decades.

104,Siltation Causes Moroccan Dams to Lose 70 Million Cubic Meters of Water,Siltation poses a significant threat to Morocco’s water resources as it causes national dams to lose a substantial amount of water every year.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 05, 2022 3:22 p.m.","Rabat - Adding to drought, siltation is causing Moroccan dams to lose up to 70 million cubic meters of water every year, putting further strain on the country’s water resources.
While dams were already running way under their full capacity because of this year’s modest rainfall, siltation is further reducing the dams’ reservoirs, an official from Morocco’s dam resources agency (ABHSM) told the news website Le360 in an interview.
“The siltation of dams is a natural phenomenon that appears as a result of soil erosion in different regions of the country,” the official said. “Unfortunately, this causes us to lose large quantities of water every year.”
All dams across Morocco suffer from siltation, with one of the country’s largest dams, the Bouregreg and Chaouia dam, losing as much as 2.5 million cubes of water to the siltation, the official explained. 
To mitigate the effect of siltation on Moroccan dams, he pointed out, the agency has adopted multiple measures including designing dams that could potentially withstand up to 50 years of soil erosion without affecting the dam’s capacity to hold water.
Other techniques the agency has adopted include planting trees and constructing protective dams. 
The measures are expected to reduce the siltation of dams in Morocco by up to 20% by 2050, the official noted.
In April of this year, Moroccan dams were running at 34.3% of their full capacity, down from 50.8% the year before. 
The notable decline in water resources is the result of the severe drought Morocco witnessed at the start of this year.

“President  Putin expressed to us his readiness to facilitate Ukrainian wheat exports,” Sall tweeted following his meeting with the Russian president. “Russia is ready to ensure the export of its wheat and fertilizers. I call on all partners to lift sanctions targeting wheat and fertilizer.”
Putin hosted Sall in his residency at the Black Sea, with the two leaders notably discussing global food shortages and grain supply disruptions, the website News Wire reported.
“I found Vladimir Putin committed and aware that the crisis and sanctions create serious problems for weak economies, such as African economies,” Sall told reporters after the meeting.
The AU official explained that he is “very reassured and very happy” with his exchange with the Russian president.
Prior to the meeting, Sall reportedly drew Putin’s attention to the potential food crisis looming over Africa.
While Africa is geographically distant from the action amid the raging Ukraine war, African “countries are victims on an economic level,” argued the Senegalese president.
He further underscored the importance of keeping food, grain, and fertilizers outside the reach of Western sanctions that had been escalating since the start of Russia’s Ukraine invasion on February 24.
Commenting on the meeting, Putin did not specifically signal out grain supply. However, he said that Russia is on Africa’s side and looks to boost cooperation with the continent.
Since the start of the Ukraine war, the US and the European Union have imposed an unprecedented amount of sanctions on Russia, prompting the country to turn to Africa and Asia.
On the backdrop of the meeting between the AU head and Russian president, Putin’s spokesperson said that the Russian president would explain to Sall the state of affairs concerning grain supplies currently stuck in Ukrainian ports.
The Kremlin spokesperson said that Russia is not blocking shipments.
Since the start of the Ukraine invasion, international organizations have sounded the alarm on the state of global food security. Many have warned that Africa will be hardest hit by the global shortage of grains and fertilizers as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters.

Echoing the trend of production, sales equally fell over the same month across the board, with the exception of the mechanical parts manufacturing and the agri-food industry. Sales have stagnated and increased respectively within the two industries, according to a recent report from Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM).
Building on the results of a monthly survey, Morocco’s central bank concluded that the country’s Capacity Utilization Rate (TUC), a measure of how much a country produces from its overall production capacity, stands at 72%.
While assessing market outlook perception, manufacturers noted that they are optimistic about market recovery for the coming three months. 19% of surveyed businesses said they feel the market is cloaked with uncertainty.
Within the agri-food industry, production increased with the industry running at 67% capacity in April, BAM said.
When asked about the three-month market outlook, professionals within the sector said that they expect an increase in the production capacity while sales would likely remain sluggish, and 40% of professionals said they expect market uncertainty to prevail.
Morocco’s least performing industry in April was the electronics manufacturing industry. The sector was running at 60% production capacity over the month, with sales dropping due to the decline in international demand and stagnation in national demand.
Businesses within the sector said they are less optimistic about market recovery prospects as they feel production and sales would stagnate over the following three months.

The latest African Hotel Chain Development Pipeline Survey, “the industry’s most authoritative source,” has documented that 5,577 hotel rooms are under construction in Morocco, representing 77.4% of the total planned rooms. 
The survey, issued by W Hospitality Group and Africa Hospitality Investment Forum (AHIF), found that Egypt in the first quarter of 2022 had the most rooms under construction, exceeding 6,000 units and belonging to a total of 85 hotel chains.  
However, most room units in Egypt remain in the planning phase, with the AHIF’s survey noting that only 28.9% of the set rooms are under construction. This reflects Egypt’s  “relatively ‘young’ pipeline (a lot signed in the last 3 years),” according to the survey.
While the report studied the hospitality sector in 42 out of 54 African countries, North African countries dominated the top 10 rankings. Egypt has 21,281 new rooms ahead of Algeria, which was placed 7th with 3,202 rooms. Following is Tunisia in the 8th position, with 2,918 rooms and the highest regional onsite construction rate of 78.1%. 
Nigeria, the highest ranked country outside of North Africa, featured in the third position with 33 new hotels and 5,619 rooms followed. Following are Ethiopia with 29 hotels, Cape Verde with 17 hotels, and Kenya with 24 hotels. 
South Africa ranked  9th with 21 hotels, while Senegal was in 10th position with 13 hotels. 
The top 10 African countries featured in the list are home to 67% of Africa’s hotels and 74% of rooms.

Hilton comes third with 55 hotels and half rooms, adding up to 10,505. Radisson Hotel Group recorded a -3.3% change compared to 2020 as it has committed to 35 new hotels with 6,248 rooms. 
Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the African and global hospitality sector, hotel chains are expected to open “200 new hotels…this year and next, although their expectations can sometimes be over-optimistic!” said Trevor Ward, Managing Director at W Hospitality Group. 
As the activities of hotel chains gradually recover in Africa,  Matthew Weihs, Managing Director of The Bench argued that “the pandemic has done nothing to dent long-term investor confidence in hospitality.”
Investors “have been encouraged by enlightened governments, such as Morocco’s, which have spent $ billions on new infrastructure to incentivize investment in tourism,” Weihs added. 
These incentives have helped revive the tourism and hospitality sectors across the continent, yet not all hotels - even top ones in Africa - did not fully recover from the hit. Hyatt hotels & resorts, Melia hotels & resorts, and Louvre hotels group have for instance recorded respectively -9.4%, -10.8%, and -4.2% change in room growth compared to 2020.

Besides sardines, frozen octopus and squid as well as fishmeal represent most of the 778,000 tonnes of Moroccan exported seafood, valued at MAD 24.2 billion ($2.46 billion). 
Yet canned sardines remain a major food export of Morocco and Dhaloomal considers the country to be a “leader in the valorization” of sardines. 
He further noted that the canned food sector in Morocco consists of roughly 50 Moroccan and international companies that are based along the country’s coastline.
Currently, the industrial zone of Sali delivers 30% of Moroccan production of sardines that is primarily exported to 100 countries. Export destinations include European countries such as the United Kingdom market, where 60% of consumed canned sardines come from Morocco. 
Dhaloomal shared the prior statements at the first edition of the Safi Investor Day. The May 25 event gathered Moroccan and foreign investors operating or interested in the Marrakech-Safi region with the objective of celebrating the region and its assets, as well as attracting additional Moroccan and foreign capital.

110,Border Reopening ‘Significantly’ Boosts Tangier Maritime Traffic,Current figures remain low compared to the pre-pandemic era.,Oumaima Latrech,"June 03, 2022 2:24 p.m.","Rabat - Traffic at Morocco’s ports in Tangier has increased significantly since the resumption of relations between Morocco and Spain.
Government Spokesperson Mustapha Baitas on Thursday stressed that about a month after the borders’ reopening between the two countries, some 116,000 passengers have passed through the ports of Tangier.
He made his remark during a press briefing following the weekly government council held in Rabat.
According to official figures, 78,497 passengers and 22,918 vehicles entered via the Tanger Med port. 
At the same time, 65,684 passengers and 18,708 vehicles left the Moroccan port for foreign destinations.
Regarding the Tangier City port, statistics indicate that 38,292 passengers contributed to 5,210 entries, while it recorded 35,967 passengers and 5,201 exits.
While the recent figures are still far from reaching those in the pre-pandemic era, it appears that there is a gradual improvement of maritime traffic at Tangier City and Tangier-Med.
Highlighting the monthly volumes, Baitas appeared optimistic about the Operation Marhaba 2022, a logistical initiative that seeks to facilitate the return of the Moroccan diaspora for the summer holidays.
The Tangier Med port authority seeks to invest MAD 150 million ($15.2 million) in infrastructure “to prepare the transit operation and ensure health security, while strengthening the port’s comfort and control capacities,” said the Deputy Director General of the Tangier Med Port Authority Hassan Abkari.
The number of check-in counters at the ferry terminal has been increased from 10 to 16, in addition to the deployment of 32 counters in the port for passengers with vehicles.
The ministerial meeting also took note of the “air services” agreement between Morocco and the Philippines, signed on March 17 in Rabat. The cabinet introduces a draft law to ratify the agreement to expand air services between our two countries.
The agreement seeks to develop an international aviation system based on competition between airlines of both countries.

113,Morocco’s Tourism Revenue Rises to MAD 14 Billion in April,Morocco’s tourism sector seems to be recovering as the threat of COVID-19 wanes.,Oussama Aamari,"June 03, 2022 12:25 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s tourism revenues have risen to MAD 14.62 billion ($1.5 billion) during the month of April, more than double the total of  MAD 6.54 billion ($668 million) during the same period in 2021.
Yet, the current boom still leaves Morocco’s tourism sector worse-off than before the pandemic. According to the Office des Changes, this figure is a 36.3% decrease from April 2019, and a 22.1% decrease from 2020.
Tourist spending has increased since last year by more than 50%, reaching MAD 4.22 billion ($431 million) in comparison to MD 2.73 billion ($278 million) in 2021.
The Directorate of Treasury and External Finance announced earlier this year that Morocco welcomed 1.5 million tourists in the first four months of 2022, noting signs of a rebound in the sector following the difficulties imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
While current numbers are lagging behind pre-pandemic days, Morocco’s government hopes that the sector will be revitalized with the easing of travel requirements, the return of Moroccans residing abroad (MREs), and the Marhaba 2022 campaign.
Operation Marhaba is an annual campaign that aims to facilitate the return of Moroccans to their country for summer vacation; the logistical operation lasts between June and September.
The tourism sector is on track to recover from the losses it sustained over the past two years, as recent figures from the Ministry of Tourism show a gradual recovery.
With the start of summer vacations, and continued publicity for Morocco as a tourist destination, the summer 2022 season is expected to show further improvement for the sector.
Recently, Morocco’s National Tourism Office launched its “Morocco, the Land of Light” campaign to promote the country as a coveted tourist destination in countries like France, the UK, and the US.

114,Morocco’s Cannabis Regulation Agency Is “Open for Business”,Morocco’s agency in charge of regulating cannabis-related economic activities has begun operations.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 03, 2022 11:30 a.m.","Rabat - Following its first meeting yesterday, Morocco’s cannabis watchdog agency is now officially operational.
The agency is set to oversee the cultivation and use of cannabis for medical and commercial purposes.
The milestone comes months after the country adopted provisional legislation in 2021 to regulate the cultivation and industrial use of cannabis. 
Chaired by Morocco’s Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit, the agency deliberated on a number of measures relating to the agency’s internal organization including management of its 2022 budget.
On the list of the agency’s responsibilities is overseeing activities along the cannabis production chain, starting from acquiring seeds to the marketing and export of cannabis-based products.
In addition, the agency will issue licenses for national and international operators within the industry working on the national level.
Regulating the cultivation and industrial use of cannabis is a first step for Morocco towards joining a fast-growing global market valued at $37 billion in 2021, and set to reach $102 billion by 2026.
In terms of production, Morocco could potentially account for almost a third of the international cannabis input, promising significant tax revenues for the state treasury. Morocco’s illicit cannabis industry is already one of the largest in the world, supplying much of European demand for the popular substance.
Proponents of regulating the industry further argue that the measure will go a long way in improving the livelihood of thousands of people who are economically dependent on the illicit industry, putting them at a socio-economic disadvantage.
Voices opposing regulating the substance stem from conservative politics and the residues of the failed war on drugs. 
While the full implications of the new legislation remain to be seen, it is noteworthy that Morocco did not by any means legalize the use of cannabis despite its widespread use in the country. Prior to the 2021 legislation, under Moroccan law, the use of cannabis for medical and industrial use was not illegal.
The new legislation was introduced to set up a legal framework for farmers, respond to a booming international market, and aim to generate tax revenue and foreign investment based on one of Morocco’s best-known exports.

Initiated by the regional council of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab, and in partnership with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, this forum attempts to promote the region's wealth and investment potential in order to advertise it to Spanish investors.
According to a regional council statement, the event will bring together companies and institutional actors to facilitate international investment in Dakhla.
This economic event will bring together private and public entities, potential investors, and businesses to discuss different options for the expansion of Morocco's trade balance with Spain, the same source notes. 
The forum aims to provide an opportunity to build new investment ties between Morocco's corporate and public sectors, particularly in agriculture, tourism, logistics, renewable energy, and fisheries.
This event intends to present networking opportunities and offers trips to regional flagship projects.
Following the Spanish government's endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the “most serious, realistic, and credible basis” for settling the Western Sahara dispute, the two countries have pledged to usher in a new era of positive ties based on mutual trust, respect, and transparency.
Morocco and Spain’s “new era” of good collaboration and closer connections has so far focused mainly on the economy and tourism as the main priorities.
Aside from this event, Dakhla is actively being promoted as a prominent investment destination. In March, the city also hosted the Morocco-US Investment Forum, which was not only a business venture but also a political initiative with diplomatic goals.

116,Morocco Suspends Oil Seed Import Duties Amid Rising Prices,"The government is also subsidizing gas and grains as international supply chain issues, COVID-19 disruptions and conflicts have caused prices to soar.",Oussama Aamari,"June 02, 2022 4:27 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s government adopted a decree on Thursday, June 2 to suspend import duties on sunflower, soybean, and rapeseed oil seeds.
The lifting of duties will come into effect starting June 3, and aims to protect citizens’ purchasing power in the face of rising global prices of various essential goods.
The decision was announced by Government Spokesperson Mustapha Baitas during a press conference on Tuesday.
Imported raw materials such as seeds make up 98% of local cooking oil production in Morocco, meaning the decision should help bring down consumer prices noticeably.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), oilseed production in Morocco has been on the decline since the 1990s, explaining the significant need for imported products in oil production.
The majority of sunflower seed production for example is dedicated to consumption as foodstuff, rather than being crushed for oil.
Since a global price hike on various products began earlier this year, Morocco’s government has put in place various subsidies as a stopgap measure of sorts in order to protect customers’ purchasing power.
In addition to oil seeds, grains and gas are also being subsidized.
Ukraine and Russia are collectively responsible for a huge chunk of the world’s supply of these essential products, meaning the war between the two has caused already rising prices to go up dramatically.
Food security has become a growing concern in the region following these developments, with regional and international figures pointing out that they’re already impacting vulnerable countries in Africa and the Middle East.
India, following a decision to suspend international wheat exports, said it would boost exports to North Africa instead, in an effort to mitigate these effects.

Shehab Mokhtar, CEO of Appetito told Forbes Middle East that Morocco and Tunisia ""are considered two key markets due to the fact that they connect Egypt and the Middle East with West Africa and French-speaking African markets.”
Appetito, since its launch in 2020, has provided quick delivery services in the growing Egyptian grocery market that is worth $60 billion. 
Over the past 10 months, the startup has recorded an average of 45% month-over-month growth and it is expecting to benefit from further q-commerce growth in the region. 
As Appetito concluded its acquisition of Lamma, founded by Yasser Ismaili El Idrissi, former General Manager of Careem in Morocco, the Egyptian startup now has access to three “dark stores” (shops catering only to online deliveries) and one distribution center in Tunisia and Morocco.
Additionally, Lamma’s founders, El Idrissi and his partner Aymen Koussi, will join the Appetito “family,” Mokhtar announced on LinkedIn. El Idrissi will hold the Chief Growth Officer position with the Egyptian startup.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, q-commerce and e-commerce have witnessed a significant increase in revenues associated with limited mobility and a change in consumer behavior. 
Quoting Redseer Strategy Consulting, Forbes said that the Middle East and North Africa region “is rapidly emerging as a global leader in quick commerce” with the sector contributing to 20% of MENA’s digital economy and is forecasted to reach $20 billion by 2024.  
In Morocco, the 2020 four-month lockdown led to a 46% surge in the volume of transactions made through Moroccan e-commerce websites. Online purchases in particular saw a 25% year-on-year growth. 
Online retailers and peer-to-peer commerce operators in Morocco also benefited from this regional and global growth. 
Despite the MENA’s struggle with “massive supply chain inefficiencies,” El Idrissi noted that “quick commerce, when executed properly, is more relevant in Africa & Middle East than in the rest of the world [thanks to its] good prices and convenience.”

Morocco’s Minister of Economic Inclusion, Small Business, Employment and Skills Younes Sekkouri held talks with the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Labor Pierre-Yves Dermagne on the sidelines of the 5th Ministerial Meeting in Marrakech.
In a statement, Dermagne highlighted the strong and historic relations between “our two royal families, the two sovereigns, as well as the two governments.”
“The Moroccan community established in Belgium represents nearly 5% of the population,” he added.
The two officials also discussed ways to boost economic cooperation while connecting Moroccan companies to their Belgium counterparts, while further focusing on economic issues and female entrepreneurship.
The Belgian official also met with the President of the Moroccan Employers' Association (CGEM) Chakib Alj on Tuesday.

The gene bank aims to preserve native crops by collecting, conserving, and developing the genetic resources in drylands. These play a key role in protecting agricultural biodiversity, as well as mitigating the food security and climate change crises. 
Morocco’s Minister of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development and Water and Forests Mohammed Sadiki, stressed in Rabat that genetic resources are a valuable heritage that must be safeguarded and preserved. 
Wild accessions and related species are vital for the development of new crops, he argued, adding that the selection of traits capable of coping with increasingly difficult weather conditions due to climate change is important.

""This gene bank is a symbol of the regeneration, resilience, and expertise of the people in this region who are working so hard to build a climate-smart future,” said the Secretary of the FAO International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture Kent Nnadozithe, during the inauguration ceremony. 
The event was attended by the Director-General of ICARDA and the Regional Director of the CGIAR, Aly Abousabaa as well as senior officials from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and embassies. Experts from universities and research institutes were also present during the ceremony.
In early 1977, the collaboration between Morocco and ICARDA focused on research programs covering fields such as food grain and pulse breeding, integrated crop-livestock systems, water management, and capacity-building.
Sadiki praised the quality of the collaboration, noting its role in strengthening the capacity of Moroccan national research institutions by providing training and technical support to develop projects such as the Moroccan System of Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.
Moreover, the National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA) gene bank in Settat currently houses a collection of nearly 72,000 accessions, including at least 13,000 accessions from the ICARDA gene bank. The progress made by INRA and ICARDA has led several other partners to join the collaborative program (FADES, CGIAR, FEMISE, IDRC, etc.).
In 2020, INRA added a part of its collection to the one million seeds of the Svalbard World Seed Reserve in Norway.

122,Ministry Signs 10 Investment Agreements for Fez-Meknes Worth MAD 160 Million,Massive investment projects will be built in the Fez-Meknes area in order to bolster its economy.,Aya Benazizi,"May 19, 2022 2:04 p.m.","Rabat - The Moroccan Ministry of Industry and Trade has signed 10 investment agreements amounting to MAD 160 million ($15.8 million) with the aim of boosting the economy of the Fez-Meknes region.
Minister of Industry and Trade Ryad Mezzour was in Fez yesterday with local industrial operators to sign 10 investment agreements for the region of Fez-Meknes, amounting to MAD 160 million ($15.8 million) and generating nearly 520 direct jobs.
Registered in the project bank launched by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, these new investments aim to strengthen SMEs in the region and boost the industrial sovereignty of Morocco. 
The projects are supported under programs such as Istitmar PME and Tatwir Green Growth.
These initiatives are divided into the following six critical industrial sectors: chemicals and plastics, textiles and clothing, building materials, electrical and electronics, automotive and renewable energies. 
Five of the ten investment projects are related to the chemical, plastics, and paperboard sectors, and include, among other things, the building or expansion of manufacturing facilities.
The sixth project focuses on the local textile and garment industry, and it aims to create ready-to-wear clothing units. 
The seventh and eighth investment programs are focused on investments in the building materials, electrical, and electronics sectors, with the goal of establishing a marble processing factory and another manufacturing outlet producing digital and intelligent electric meters.
The remaining two projects are related to the development of a radiator production unit and the installation of a solar panel manufacturing line.
“The industrial sovereignty of our country is inevitably achieved through SMEs,” the minister noted. These new projects, which we have supported and followed, are indicative. They provide tangible evidence of the important role that SMEs play as a vector of regional industrial development and strong link of its economic dynamics,” Mezzour said.
Fez-Meknes is the 5th national region in terms of projects funded by the Task Force Sovereignty Ministry, he added.  
“To date, we have 81 investment projects in this region, with Moroccan capital funding 75% of them. This represents 5,536 direct jobs and potential import substitution of MAD 2.5 million ($247,757) and export to MAD 1.574 million ($155,988),” Mezzour underlined.
For him, “the region of Fez-Meknes confirms its dynamism through the variety of industrial sectors that are developing, attesting to its position as an economic hub that generates wealth and employment.”
Thus, he concluded, “we will continue to work together with SMEs to further promote local production.”

123,Bangladesh Plans To Purchase OCP Fertilizers,The import will be at higher prices amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 19, 2022 1:45 p.m.","Rabat - Bangladesh is set to import 40,0000 tonnes of diammonium phosphate fertilizer also known as DAP from Moroccan phosphate giant OCP Group.
Bangladeshi outlet the Daily Star reported that the government approved the import of the Moroccan fertilizer in a meeting on Wednesday.
The news outlet emphasized that the import price will be $21 higher than the “per tonne price” set previously.
The development is due to the global context marked by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and lingering supply chain issues following the COVID-19 crisis.
Bangladeshi officials emphasized that the diammonium phosphate fertilizer will cost the country $1775 per tonne.
Previously the fertilizer's cost for a tonne was set at $874 per tonne.
In 2021, however, the average cost of a tonne of diammonium phosphate was estimated at $616 per tonne.
Several countries expressed interest in Morocco’s fertilizer products amid the Ukraine-Russia conflict which has disrupted traditional supplies from Eastern Europe.
Recently, Peru announced its country’s plan to purchase Moroccan fertilizers.
“There have been talks with the governments of Morocco, Venezuela, and Bolivia. Once the Emergency Decree is approved, the purchase will proceed. The logistical coordination for the transfer is already being made so that it reaches the farmers quickly,” Peru’s Minister of Agrarian Development Oscar Zea said.
Morocco has around 75% of the world’s reserves of phosphate rock, a vital mineral used to make phosphate-based fertilizers.
The high demand for Morocco’s fertilizers is set to positively impact OCP’s revenues.
The group has shared substantial numbers with regard to its revenues for the first quarter of 2022.
In a recent press release, OCP announced that it reached a MAD 25.3 billion in revenue in the first three months.
The $2.5 billion in revenue represents a 77% increase compared to the same period in 2021.
OCP attributed the positive performance to the growing international demand for phosphate.
“The Russian-Ukrainian conflict intensified the tense situation in terms of supply/demand balance in the phosphate market and led to a further rise in prices, which was also supported by the increase in raw material costs, in particular ammonia,” OCP Group said in a statement.

124,Chariot Raises $25.5 Million For Offshore Gas project in Morocco,Chariot group will allocate the funding to advance the engineering and design of the Anchois Gas Development Project Offshore Morocco.,Sara Zouiten,"May 19, 2022 1:37 p.m.","Rabat - Africa-focused energy exploration company Chariot announced today that it has raised $25.5 million (MAD 257 million) to progress its flagship Anchois offshore gas project in Morocco, as well as its other renewable energy projects across Africa.
The Anchois gas development project, which falls under the Lixus Offshore drilling license, covers an area of around 2,390km², with a water depth that ranges from the coastline to 850 meters.
The Anchois-1 and Anchois-2 gas discoveries represent a high-value gas appraisal and development project. The explorations led to the discovery of “excellent quality, dry gas across seven reservoirs with approximately 150m net pay,” according to the company.
Chariot aims to improve the African energy market for mining operations by providing and generating “cleaner, sustainable, and more reliable power.” The British company has partnered with various African countries to develop large-scale green hydrogen projects, including Mauritania.
Chariot’s acting CEO Andonis Pouroulis expressed his delight with the support and funding the company has received and pledged to “remain fully aligned with our shareholder base, demonstrating our commitment and belief in the value and future growth of our business.”
“We are excited about moving the Anchois development towards FID and we look forward to updating the market in this regard, as well as with our progress across our wider portfolio,"" Pouroulis added.
In February 2022, Chariot locked a deal with Morocco’s National Hydrocarbons and Mining Office (ONHYM) to acquire a new offshore exploration and drilling license - Anchois-2 - near the city of Larache in northern Morocco.
Last month, the energy company announced upgrading estimates on Anchois-2 gas appraisal from 100 meters to 150 meters, against 55 meters in the original Anchois-1.
“Our ambition is to bring the Anchois gas development online quickly, to fuel Morocco’s economic growth, but also to deliver near-term cash flows to our shareholders,” Pouroulis confirmed.
Chariot holds 74% of the Anchois project interest, while Morocco’s ONYHM has a 25% stake.

125,Morocco Co-launched Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance,The six-members alliance urges the public and private sectors to work together to cut hydrogen production costs.,Souad Anouar,"May 19, 2022 1:35 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco has launched the African Green Hydrogen Alliance to increase access to clean and affordable energy along with Mauritania, Egypt,  Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa. 
The Green Hydrogen Organization reported that the six African countries officially launched the alliance on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Green Hydrogen Global Assembly in Barcelona. 
The alliance opts to foster collaboration between its founding members to advance green hydrogen development in the respective countries. It also calls for adopting regulatory and policy reforms, building local capacities, and encouraging investments in green hydrogen production to meet domestic needs. 
Commenting on the initiative, Jonas Moberg, CEO of the Green Hydrogen Organization, underlined the necessity of green hydrogen in the African energy transition. He emphasized that the relatively clean alternative “must provide energy for Africa’s growing population and industrial needs [and] offer a major export opportunity for the continent.”
Moberg further called for coordination between governments, the private sector,  banks, experts, and civil society actors to reduce hydrogen production costs and accelerate electrolysis. This scientific process uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen to produce carbon-free hydrogen.

UN Climate Change High-Level Champions from the UK and Egypt  Nigel Topping and Mahmoud Mohieldin echoed Moberg’s statements. They noted Africa’s potential in becoming “a frontrunner in this burgeoning green hydrogen industry, creating zero-emission jobs, domestic energy supplies and export revenues fit for a decarbonized future.”
The African Green Hydrogen Alliance received the support of the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions, the Green Hydrogen Organization, the African Development Bank, and the UN Economic Commission for Africa. 
As the alliance members are developing their renewable energy programs, they are among the frontrunners for green energy in the region. 
Morocco, for instance, remains a net energy importer. Yet, it has the potential to emerge as a global supplier of clean hydrogen by 2030, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. 
However, the low rate of technological innovation in the country - associated with low research and development funds and grants - represents a burden on the Moroccan green hydrogen roadmap that seeks to supply the national market with 4 terawatt-hours and the international market with 10 terawatt-hours by 2030.

Morocco’s Minister of Economic Inclusion, Small Business, Employment and Skills Younes Sekkouri, and the Portuguese Secretary of State for Labor Miguel Fontes made the remarks on Wednesday in Marrakech.
The working group is part of a mobility agreement signed in January 2022 between Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and his Portuguese counterpart Santos Silva, during a meeting in which they discussed the need to develop bilateral cooperation.
The agreement seeks to enable Moroccan workers to legally work in Portugal. Pending its ratification, the two countries pledged to accelerate cooperation and prepare for its implementation.
Sekkouri and Fontes said on the sidelines of the 5th Ministerial Meeting at Marrakech Private University (UpM) that the joint group will meet regularly until the ratification of the mobility agreement.
The group will include Moroccan and Portuguese government representatives, as well as members from Portugal’s Institute of Employment and Vocational Training and Morocco's National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills (ANAPEC).
The group is expected to work on several projects aimed at providing companies with the manpower they need, while boosting employment opportunities for Moroccan workers in Portugal in legal and safe conditions.
During the meeting, the two officials focused on topics of common interest, including the issues related to the mobility of young people, students, and workers, stressing that the agreement signed between Lisbon and Rabat also seeks to facilitate the way for students aiming to continue their studies in Portugal.
Meanwhile, the Moroccan minister noted that they are currently in the process of implementing a convention, which is the result of a multisectoral coordination in the two countries.

128,World Bank To Spend $30 Billion On Food Security,The World Bank adopted measures to protect food security all over the world.,Yassine Biyad,"May 19, 2022 10:05 a.m.","Rabat - The World Bank will spend $30 billion over the next 15 months on projects to face global food security.
The World Bank Group announced on Wednesday a comprehensive global response to address growing food insecurity that has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The measures target vital fields such as agriculture, nutrition, social protection, water, and irrigation, the bank said in a press release.
""In total, this represents more than $30 billion available for implementation to address food insecurity over the next 15 months,"" the World Bank said on Wednesday in a press release.
The statement added that the group is currently working with countries to prepare projects worth $12 billion “to support agriculture, social protection to cushion the effects of higher food prices, and water and irrigation projects.”
""Rising food prices are having a devastating impact on the poorest and most vulnerable,"" World Bank Group President David Malpass said. 
The bank also shed light on $18.7 billion in undisbursed balances that will also be available for projects directly related to food security.
The majority of the resources will go to countries in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, as well as Central and South Asia. They aim to encourage food and fertilizer production, enhance food systems, facilitate greater trade, and support vulnerable households and producers.

The World Bank’s global response will focus on four priorities such as facilitating increased trade, building consensus (G7, G20, others), and avoiding the further rise in global food prices due to export restrictions. The global response will also address food systems’ resilience to rising risks (conflict, climate, pests, diseases), and economic disruptions.
Malpass urged countries to make ""concerted efforts"" to ""remove policies that block exports and imports…or encourage unnecessary storage,"" and not only focus on increasing energy and fertilizer supplies.
Over the years, the World Bank has gained experience in global food crises, which helped it build up new tools dedicated to responding to such issues, including the IDA Crisis Response Window.
The World Bank also hosts the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), which is an existing financial intermediary fund dedicated to improving food security in low-income countries.

130,"Morocco, Germany Strengthen Cooperation in Various Fields",Germany and Morocco are keen to expand bilateral cooperation in a range of fields.,Aya Benazizi,"May 18, 2022 5:18 p.m.","Casablanca - With the aim of strengthening Moroccan-German cooperation, Younes Sekkouri, Minister of Economic Integration, Small Business, Employment, and Skills met yesterday with Barbel Kofler, Parliamentary State Secretary at the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The two officials met during a meeting on the margins of the 5th Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) Ministerial Conference on Employment and Labor, which was held from May 17 to May 18 in Marrakech.
During these talks, the two officials reaffirmed their commitment to working towards a socio-ecological transformation of industry and the economy in general, as well as how Germany might keep up with these changes.
Although Morocco and Germany have been at odds diplomatically in recent times owing to Berlin's stance on Western Sahara, the two countries decided in February to begin a new chapter in their bilateral ties.
The new German government then appeared keen to reestablish regular relations between the two countries, considering the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as an essential contribution to resolving the Western Sahara dispute.
After Morocco recalled its Ambassador to Berlin Zohour Alaoui, in May 2021 for discussions amid rising diplomatic tensions between Berlin and Rabat, the country has since confirmed his return in February 2022.
With these recent diplomatic advances, Morocco and Germany are well on their way to reinvigorating bilateral relations, beginning with the economy, which was the focus of the Marrakech meeting.
Kofler was informed of Morocco's most recent policy changes related to the country’s  New Development Model, as well as the country's main programs, including the expansion of social protection.
During her visit, Kofler also met with the Minister of Economy and Finance Nadia Fattah Alaoui on Monday in Rabat, in order to discuss ways to strengthen bilateral collaboration in a variety of disciplines.

131,Morocco’s Agrobusiness Suffers From Lack of Rainfall,"Despite the low precipitation in the first months of 2022, Morocco still notes relieving rates.",Yassine Biyad,"May 18, 2022 5:06 p.m.","Rabat - Moroccan dam reservoirs intended for agricultural use currently have a 2 billion m³ deficit in water reserves compared to last year.
Morocco’s Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development and Water and Forestry Mohammed Sadiki recalled that rainfall this year had come late, low, and “poorly patterned in terms of time and territory,”while assessing the current agricultural campaign at the House of Representatives.
Sadiki said that 60% of the total precipitation occurred in March and April. Referring to the ministry’s data, he noted that rainfall across Morocco has only reached 200 mm since the beginning of the agricultural campaign, marking a 43% drop compared to the average of the last 30 years.
Despite lower precipitation, rainfall has restored the vegetation cover to a “normal” level in some regions. Satellite images of vegetation cover show vegetation profiles “that are nearly close to the 2015-2016 harvest year”, the minister added.
Sadiki reported that nearly 3.6 million hectares of cereal crops were planted this year, with 60% of production coming from the regions of Fez-Meknes, Rabat-Sale-Kenitra, and Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima. He added that the expected production of major grains (soft wheat, durum wheat, and barley) is estimated at 32 million quintals (Mq), down 69% from the previous record year.
Still, cereals produced in irrigated areas have contributed only roughly 20% of overall production due to the limited size of the irrigated area dedicated to cereals and the irrigation restrictions imposed on these areas.
The Moroccan minister said that rainfall in March and April helped the spring crops grow in favorable conditions. He noted that the total cultivated area has reached 230,000 hectares, including corn (115,000 hectares), chickpeas (75,000 hectares), sunflowers (30,000 hectares), and beans (8,700 hectares).
The cultivated area of sugar beet is nearly 39,000 hectares and that of sugar cane is 10,000 hectares. Despite the decrease in the area cultivated this year, the preliminary forecasts expect the production of 380,000 tons of white sugar.
Regarding crops in the flowering stage (citrus, olive, palm, and rosaceous), Sadiki said that they showed good production prospects, despite their high dependency on weather conditions in May, June, and early July.

However, when it comes to food exports, Sadiki noted that fruits and vegetables have recorded an increase of 18% (nearly 1.246 million tons) compared to 2021.
Tomatoes remain the most exported fruit, representing 46% of total food exports. Citrus exports also increased by 41% (707,000 tonnes) compared to the previous year.
He also stressed that the improvement of rangeland and fodder resources for the spring season, as well as support for farmers by the National Office of Food Safety (ONSSA) helped the livestock market recover. The health situation of livestock is satisfactory in all regions of Morocco, he added. 
As part of preparations for Eid Al-Adha, Sadiki highlighted that 240,000 fattening units of livestock had been identified and registered in Morocco. The identification process of sheep and goats is expected to cover 7 million animals.  
""Taking into account all these factors, the gross domestic product of agriculture should record a maximum decline of 14% this year, due to the difficult climatic conditions and the exceptional performance recorded last year,” he concluded.

132,World Bank: Shadow Economy Employs 77% of Morocco’s Labor Market,Morocco holds the highest rate of shadow economy employment and some of the lowest female labor force participation in the world.,Jihane Rahhou,"May 18, 2022 11:16 a.m.","Rabat - A new World Bank report on the labor markets of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries has established that over 70% of Morocco’s labor market operates in the informal economy, the highest in the region. 
Informal labor indicates an employment status where workers have no access to healthcare, retirement, or insurance covering risks associated with the job.
While the MENA region boasts one of the youngest populations globally, youth unemployment remains rampant as one in every three young people in the region is not engaged in a job, education, or training, according to the World Bank report.
Regarding women's participation in the labor force, the MENA is at the bottom with female labor participation standing at 20%, the report indicates.
The region seems to be also lagging behind in terms of the number of women-led firms. While more than 20% of firms are led by women in lower and upper-middle-income countries, the best-performing MENA country - Tunisia - does not exceed the 15% threshold.
The percentage of women-led businesses in Morocco is a little more than 5% of all companies, data suggests.
In addition to these challenges, the region does not seem to have a business-enabling environment, as firms that are less than five years old constitute less than 10% of all businesses in the region, the report says. 
The figure is a far cry from the 15% in lower and upper-middle-income countries. Young firms’ share in Morocco’s business landscape stands at 8% of all businesses, the report indicates.
Despite research and innovation being necessary for growth, businesses in the MENA region are less likely to invest in Research and Development (R&D) ventures, according to the report. Only around 7% of MENA businesses invest in R&D, it details. 
Tunisia is the only MENA country that stands out in this regard, with over 18% of Tunisian businesses heavily investing in R&D research. Morocco comes in second with a little more than 14%.

133,CDG Group’s Insurance Secures Approval for Islamic Insurance Venture,Morocco welcomes its first Islamic reinsurance “Retakaful” institution.,Jihane Rahhou,"May 18, 2022 10:50 a.m.","Rabat - Societe Centrale de Reassurance (SCR) has acquired the necessary authorization from Morocco’s Insurance and Social Security Supervisory Authority (ACAPS) to launch “Retakaful” reinsurance services, an insurance institution part of the Islamic banking system.
SCR is the reinsurance arm of the CDG Group, Morocco’s state-owned fund that manages the country’s long-term savings. It is also the leading reinsurance institution in the country.
After locking the approval for this new venture, SCR will now diversify its offer and gain a new base of customers from the country’s Islamic financing sector, the group said in a press release. 
Speaking on the backdrop of gaining the approval from the country’s insurance watchdog, SCR’s Management said that the approval is in line with the company’s “ambitions for its activities’ growth and expansion.”
With the new approval, which is Morocco’s first Retakaful venture, SCR will use its “Retakaful” services in Morocco to become a major player in the country’s Islamic reinsurance market, the company said.
Morocco’s Islamic financing system is a relatively new enterprise. Since its debut in 2018, Islamic or participative banking has maintained a record for the highest annual growth rate within any sub banking sector.
However, the country had only welcomed its first Islamic insurance institution in 2021, with the launch of Takafulia Assurance.
Islamic or participative funding in Morocco is especially in high demand when it comes to housing loans. 
Demand for participative financing for housing grew at an annual rate of 32% in 2021, according to data from Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM).
Despite the notable growth, the country’s Islamic banking landscape remains underdeveloped and has a long way to go before it can become competitive with Islamic funding institutions in the Middle East.

Arata announced his country’s intent to import large quantities of phosphates and fertilizers from Morocco to support Japan’s agricultural production, specifying that the country seeks to boost its agricultural output by next autumn.
“Morocco is a world power in phosphates. For this reason, my country is interested in importing a large quantity of fertilizers,” the Japanese Deputy Minister said during a press briefing.
Morocco’s OCP Group has grown into one of the world’s leading fertilizer exporters, taking advantage of the country’s sizable phosphate reserves.
In addition to the new fertilizer imports, the two politicians finalized details relating to other agricultural exchanges between the countries.
The Asian country will start importing Moroccan citrus fruits such as oranges, adding to the produce it already imports like coriander seeds, thyme, and strawberries.
Morocco’s main agricultural import from Japan is green tea leaves.
The meeting between Arata and Sadiki also saw Japan committing to financing several projects in the maritime and fishing sides, such as training programs, and scientific research.
The two countries have in recent months repeatedly pledged to strengthen cooperation in various sectors. Morocco displayed its “Morocco Now” brand in Tokyo’s streets earlier this year, while Japan has made donations to Moroccan associations for the benefit of Morocco’s rural agricultural areas.
Takebe Arata is also expected to meet with Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita, as well as the Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Leila Benali.

First founded in 2019, Kifal offers additional car-related services including access to financing and insurance among other services.
The Moroccan startup was first incubated by CDG Invest’s 212 Founders accelerator program, a state-backed program aiming to boost Morocco and Africa’s startup ecosystem.
Morocco’s automotive sector is projected to grow to $14 billion in five years' time, which means the new acquisition will provide Autocheck with access to one of Africa’s most developed automotive markets.

With the lab being the first of its kind in Africa, Oracle and its Moroccan partners -- the government and Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) -- hope for the facility to accelerate Morocco’s digital turn and make the country a pivotal point in the digitization of African economies.
Safra Catz, CEO of Oracle emphasized that the tech giant's investment in Morocco “reflects the improved economic environment we see among the signatories of the Abraham Accords, the monumental agreement that is forming peace and prosperity across the region.”
Casablanca’s Oracle Lab will house up to 100 researchers, who will have access to the company’s cloud, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies.
The Oracle features will help researchers tackle some of the most pressing, high-tech-related challenges facing different sectors, particularly science, business, and the public sector.
Catz emphasized that the research and development center in Casablanca will enable Orale “to access an outstanding pool of talent from across the region.”
Echoing the same optimism and trust in the transformative potential of the project as Morocco increasingly embraces digitization, Delegate Minister for Investment Mohcine Jaouli said the establishment of the lab in Morocco speaks volumes about how far the country has come in its digitization drive. “We are delighted that Oracle has selected Morocco as the location for the expansion of its global  R&D program,” he said.
The opening of the lab provides the “opportunity for talented people in Morocco to help create world-leading technology solutions,” Jazzouli emphasized, describing the lab as the first step towards placing the North African country at the heart of Oracle’s business in the region.
Oracle Labs are focusing to identify, explore, and transfer new technologies to help solve the world’s emerging challenges, according to Vice President of Research and Advanced Development in Oracle Labs Hassan Chafi.
“In addition to their outstanding technical skills, most engineers in Morocco speak three languages and bring an open-minded and creative approach to their work,” Chafi said. 
Moroccan talents’ capacities,  he said, make them “ideal members of a team focused on developing technology that will play a significant role in our rapidly evolving, global society.”
The lab in Casablanca is part of Oracle’s global research and development network, using cloud-based technologies. It is set to develop projects focused on technologies, including automated machine learning, among others.

137,"Morocco’s UM6P, Oracle Pledge to Accelerate Digital Economy in Africa",The IT giant recently opened its first African Oracle Lab in Morocco.,Oumaima Latrech,"May 17, 2022 5:12 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) and the world’s giant database management company Oracle Corporation have pledged to cooperate on research and development and further boost digitalization in the African continent.
UM6P is hosting a two-day event with the attendance of Oracle’s CEO Safra Ada Catz as well as several other representatives from the corporation, the OCP Group, and the Moroccan government.
At a ceremony UM6P hosted to welcome Oracle representatives and senior members of the Moroccan government, the university's president, Hicham El Habti, noted the school’s conviction that interactions between business and research are indispensable for economic and social growth. As such, he explained, UM6P has long been determined to forge dialogue, engagement, and partnerships with leaders in the corporate world.
El Habti made his remarks at the Oracle Lab announcement today at Morocco’s Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P). First of its kind in Africa, the Oracle Lab is located at Casanearshore Park in Casablanca and is expected to have a total of 100 researchers operating in the research and development and the IT industry.
The researchers will have access to Oracle’s cloud, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies aimed at addressing emerging challenges related to business, science, and the public sector.
El Habti stressed that Africa has witnessed significant changes in the last decade and has specifically accelerated its digital transformation to meet emerging challenges in today’s fast-moving and increasingly digitized world. “Ten years ago, only 13% of Africans were estimated to have access to the internet, the number exceeded 43% today,” he noted.  
In his speech, the UM6P president highlighted Morocco’s efforts in implementing development projects related to infrastructure, boosting investments, and showing “serious commitment to the continent’s development.”
A ‘revolution in the making’
El Habti also recalled UM6Ps main ambition of fostering education, research, and innovation to reach sustainable development in Morocco and beyond, noting, “we are aware that our development model will be unique as it aims to respond to the needs of our continent.”
Speaking of digitization in Africa, he stressed that there is an “African digital revolution in the making,” with several research areas, mainly food security, renewable energy, and sustainable nutrition having adopted a digital approach that contributes to the continent’s growth toward a social change.
Speaking to MWN, UM6P professor Rachid Guerraoui emphasized that Morocco’s human talents constitute a significant asset for the country in today’s knowledge-driven globalized economy.
“The visit of Oracle’s CEO today in Morocco testifies that Morocco and Africa in general has this [human] talent and we need to make such that such young potentials stay in the country and contribute to the IT industry,” Professor Guerraoui said.
Ghita Mezzour, Minister Delegate for Digital Transition and Administrative Reform, told MWN that Oracle Lab’s investment in research and development in Morocco “is a testimony that Moroccan youth are qualified and trained in the latest technologies.”
The American multinational Oracle is set to collaborate with several Moroccan operators from the high-tech sector to ensure the transfer of its advanced, state-of-the-art technologies to the Casablanca-based facility.
During the ceremony, Hassan Chafi, Research Manager at Oracle Labs, recalled Morocco’s
achievements -- such as ranking first in Africa in quality of infrastructure, automotive and aerospace manufacturing, and tourism.

Of Morocco’s growing embrace of the digital economy, Chafi said the country has yet to meet its full potential. He especially highlighted the Benguerir-based coding school 1337 and its notable performance in shifting the learning approach toward a more digitized one.
“With a partner like Oracle, we can reach our full potential, and while in Morocco, the company can also have access to young talents,” he added.
With Morocco steadily building up its digital infrastructure to support an economy that is increasingly dependent on technology, UM6P has been playing a pivotal role in the transition.
In 2021, the university inaugurated Africa’s most powerful supercomputer, with the mission of playing a front-seat role in Morocco’s -- and Africa’s by extension -- quest to be part of the global conversation in areas such artificial intelligence and smart or sustainable agriculture.
The university also launched the “AgriFood Tech” incubator, an initiative for startups in the agricultural sector, earlier this year, in addition to other efforts to support tech startups.

138,Morocco’s Gas Subsidies Reach ‘Historic’ Level,"Adverse geopolitics continue to push energy prices higher, weighing down on Morocco’s subsidies fund.",Jihane Rahhou,"May 17, 2022 3:57 p.m.","Rabat - Gas subsidies have reached “historic” levels in Morocco, with the country’s subsidies fund currently covering 74% of the original price for a unit of a gas bottle, amounting to MAD 116 ($12.8). 
Over the first five months of 2022, Morocco’s subsidies fund is projected to spend MAD 9.2 billion ($965.9 million) on gas subsidies alone. 
Given current gas prices, Morocco’s energy subsidies will likely rise to a MAD 22 billion ($2,3 billion) at the end of 2022, up by 51% from last year, Lakjaa said. 
The fund continues to alleviate price pressures on staple commodities preserving the national purchasing power, Deputy Minister for State Budget, Faouzi Lakjaa, said on Monday.
Responding to MPs' questions during a hearing in Morocco’s House of Representatives, Lakjaa explained that the global rise in commodities had put significant pressure on the fund’s resources.
In addition to the increase in the fund’s spending, the government has taken a number of measures to control wheat prices including suspending import fees on wheat since November 2021, Lakjaa said.
During the first four months of 2022, Morocco spent MAD 2.52 billion ($264.5 million) to import 20 quintals of wheat, and wheat subsidies averaged MAD 113 ($11.8) per quintal over the same period, the deputy minister explained.
Overall wheat subsidies are expected to reach MAD 7.32 billion ($768.5 million) to keep bread prices at the MAD 1.2 ($0.13) price tag, he added.
Regarding energy subsidies, Lekjaa pointed out that Morocco spent MAD 7.3 billion ($766.4 million) on gas subsidies, up from MAD 4.2 billion ($440.9 million) last year.
Between January and May 2022, gas subsidies averaged MAD 100 ($10.5) per gas unit of 12 kilograms, covering 71% of the original prices, he detailed.
Over the first four months of 2022, Morocco allocated MAD 11.8 billion ($1.2 billion) to subsidies for food and energy commodities, an 87% year-on-year increase.
Despite these measures, the country’s inflation rate has already exceeded the 5% threshold, sending commodities prices higher and weighing down on the national purchasing power.

139,Colas Rail Secures €15 Million Contract For Casablanca Tramway Lines,Colas Rail has been present in Morocco since 2008 and involved in the construction of tramway systems since the early stages.,Souad Anouar,"May 17, 2022 1:40 p.m.","Rabat - France-based Colas Rail has secured a €15 million contract for building low-voltage systems for lines T3 and T4 of the Casablanca tramway. 
The project is expected to last for 30 months. Coral Rail will conduct studies for the project, install the low-voltage systems on track, and implement systems for video surveillance and sound, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), the multiservice network, time synchronization, and telecoms. 
“This new contract shows that there is a real bond, built on trust, between the Moroccan local authorities and Colas Rail,” Herve Le Joliff, Chairman of Colas Rail said last week in a press release.
“As in previous projects for the Casablanca tramway, our teams are fully mobilized to deliver an integrated, reliable and safe system to our historical partner,” he added.
In 2021, Colas Rail won a contract for electrification and the laying of railway tracks for the central section of the T3 and T4 lines of the Casablanca tramway. 
The two lines are set to consolidate the public transport services in Morocco’s most populated city, Casablanca, which is home to nearly 4 million inhabitants. 
Line T3 will cover 14 kilometers of double-track platform and 20 new stations while line T4, also a double-track platform, will have 19 stations.

The new line extensions are financed by a €100 million loan from the French Development Agency (AFD) and an additional $100 million loan from the International Finance Corporation.  
“These two lines will be carried out simultaneously according to a common schedule and will require an investment budget of 7 billion dirhams. Their provisional commissioning is scheduled for 2024,” Casa Transport said in 2020.
Present in Morocco since 2008 and involved in the construction of tramway systems since its early stages, Colas Rail was chosen to develop the new Casablanca lines as it previously did with lines 1 and 2 in Rabat and Casablanca as well as the latest line extensions in Rabat.

140,Morocco’s Tourism Revenues Reached Nearly $1 Billion in March,"Morocco has in recent weeks taken several measures to invigorate its hard-hit, essential tourism sector after two years of pandemic-induced disruptions.",Safaa Kasraoui,"May 17, 2022 1:28 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s tourism appears to be on track to recover the losses it suffered during the peak of the COVID crisis, with revenues reaching MAD 9.7 billion (nearly $1 billion) at the end of March 2022. 
The figures represent an 80% increase compared to the same period last year, Minister of Tourism Fatim-Zahra Ammor announced on Monday.
Speaking during a parliamentary session at the House of Representatives, Ammor emphasized that the noted increase in Morocco’s tourism revenues comes to confirm that the sector has considerably recovered from its COVID-induced losses since the reopening of borders in February.
She pointed to the measures the government has taken to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, notably recalling the launch of a MAD 2 billion ($199.75 million) emergency plan to revive the sector and provide financial assistance to hard-hit employees.  
Ammor also recalled the campaigns Morocco has launched to revive its hospitality industry and double the number of tourist arrivals by 2030.
Morocco’s National Tourist Office (ONMT) has in recent weeks launched a series of campaigns to attract more tourists and tourism operators to the North African kingdom. 
The ultimate goal is to invigorate Morocco’s hard-hit, essential tourism sector after two years of pandemic-induced disruptions to the hospitality industry.
“Morocco, the Land of Light” is one of the campaigns ONMT launched in April to list Morocco among the “world’s most coveted tourist destinations.” 
The campaign notably aims to reinforce the country's notoriety and attractiveness in the international market, and its targets include France, Spain, Germany,  the UK, the US, Israel, as well as African and Middle Eastern states. It also aims to attract tourists aged between 25 and 59, including people that are interested in beaches, culture, and nature.
On Monday this week,  ONMT announced the launch of its “Light Tour” in Paris, London, and New York,” noting that the initiative seeks to put more focus on Morocco’s tourism assets as part of ONMT’s vision for post-COVID recovery.
The tour will kick off in Paris today, followed by London tomorrow, and New York on May 19
“We will continue our work to promote Morocco in international markets. In the aftermath of the Land of Light campaign, it was important for us to fully involve Moroccan professionals in promoting Morocco as a holiday destination,” ONMT General Director Abdel El Fakir said.

141,"800,000 Moroccan Farmers Benefit From Social Security Coverage","With a target of reaching 1.6 million farmers, Morocco’s agriculture ministry set in place regional bodies to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the program.",Jihane Rahhou,"May 17, 2022 12:33 p.m.","Rabat - Approximately 800,000 farmers currently benefit from social security coverage, bringing Morocco closer to reaching its target of 1.6 million.
Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development, and Water and Forests Minister Mohammed Sadiki revealed the figures during a hearing session on Monday at Morocco’s House of Representatives, noting that the ministry remains committed to extending the social safety net to the 1.6 million farmers targeted.
To reach that target, the ministry tasked regional agriculture departments with the task of monitoring, implementing, and evaluating the program, the minister explained.
Responding to an MP’s question concerning wildfires affecting Morocco’s oases, Sadiki said that protecting these natural resources is central to his ministry’s strategy.
In 2010, Morocco created the National Agency for Oasis and the Argan Tree (ANDZOA) with the primary goal of coordinating efforts between stakeholders to preserve the country’s oases and Argan trees, the minister explained.
In addition to creating the agency, the ministry inked a three-year funding agreement with the Draa-Tafilalet region, mobilizing MAD 545 million ($54.4 million)  to preserve oases across the country. 
Having already set in motion a proactive approach to dealing with wildfires that covers prevention and ensures rapid intervention, the ministry will gradually implement the approach nationwide, Sadiki pointed out.
He listed a number of measures that the agriculture ministry had adopted to preserve Morocco’s natural resources, including investing in infrastructure and extending the country’s green spaces.
Morocco’s agriculture sector accounts for an average of 11% of the country’s Gross Domestic Production (GDP) and employs 66% of Morocco’s urban population. 
As of this year, however, Morocco’s agriculture sector is heavily dependent on rainfall, making it especially vulnerable to adverse weather.

142,"Morocco, UNIDO Sign Two Declarations on Decarbonization, Green Hydrogen",Morocco works on reducing green gas emissions and adopting green energy sources to address climate change challenges.,Souad Anouar,"May 17, 2022 12:11 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) have signed two joint declarations on the promotion of industrial decarbonization and green hydrogen. 
“UNIDO DG Muller on his first official visit to Africa and the Arab region, in Morocco, signs Joint Declarations to support the industrial sector and the SDGs,” UNIDO tweeted on Monday. 
UNIDO Director-General Gerd Muller and Morocco’s Minister of Industry and Trade Ryad Mezzour signed yesterday a declaration that underpinned the national strategy for the fight against climate change. 
The document called for the development of a national plan to coordinate and monitor the gradual reduction of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases in the industrial sector to decarbonize industrial activities. 
The joint declaration also instructed the development of an industrial analysis platform (IAP) to identify and implement “digital innovation projects and capacity building programs in the areas of industrial decarbonization, technology transfer and advanced digital production, international trade and investment,” Mezzour said. 
Morocco’s Minister for Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Leila Benali joined Muller and Mezzour in the signing of the second joint declaration on the development of green hydrogen.

""This new impetus to our partnership will promote…industrial decarbonization and resilient, inclusive and sustainable development, as well as the priorities of the new development model of the Kingdom,” Mezzour said, noting that the objective is to make “Morocco the most competitive carbon-free industrial base in the world.”
For his part, Muller stated that “UNIDO will use its partnership platform to support Morocco in renewable energy, circular economies, and data-driven industry to achieve the ambitious goals of decarbonization of the industrial sector and the SDGs.”
The advancement of cooperation with Morocco and UNIDO was also on the agenda of Muller’s meetings with the Head of Government Aziz Akhanouch and Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita.
During Muller’s visit, Morocco launched an industrial estate portal. The platform was developed in partnership with UNIDO, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Millennium Challenge Account-Morocco, and the developers of industrial zones in Morocco. 
It shares technical details on the Moroccan industrial zones and the latest news related to the regulation or development of such areas to better inform investors on Morocco’s appeal as a prime destination for doing business.

143,OCP Group’s Turnover Rises by 77% in First Quarter of 2022,OCP is committed to increasing its production volume by 10% in 2022 to meet the growing demand for phosphate in the global market.,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 17, 2022 11:22 a.m.","Rabat - The turnover of Morocco’s giant fertilizer group OCP reached MAD 25.32 billion ($2.50 billion) in the first quarter of 2022, indicating a 77% increase compared to the same period in 2021.
OCP’s turnover witnessed a strong performance during the first three months of this year, with the total figures -- MAD 25.32 billion -- being pointedly higher than the MAD 14.28 billion ($1.41 billion) the company’s purse registered in 2021.
OCP attributed the positive performance to the growing international demand for phosphate.
“The Russian-Ukrainian conflict intensified the tense situation in terms of supply/demand balance in the phosphate market and led to a further rise in prices, which was also supported by the increase in raw material costs, in particular ammonia,” OCP Group said in a statement.
The group noted it aspires to increase its production volume by 10% in 2022 to meet the demand in high-growth markets in a bid to further consolidate its standing as a world leader in its sector.
OCP’s gross margin stood at MAD 15.88 billion ($1.57 billion) this year against MAD 9.26 ($917.69 million) in 2021, indicating that the rise in selling prices neutralized the impact of the increase in input costs -- particularly for sulfur and ammonia. The company’s gross margin rate was 63%  in the first quarter of 2022 against 65% in the same period in 2021.
Meanwhile, the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- also known as EBITDA -- recorded a year-on-year growth of 117%. OCP’s latest EBITDA stood at MAD 11.30 billion ($1.11 billion) against MAD 5.33 billion ($528.21 million) in 2021.
The company explained that the increase in revenues resulted in a record EBITDA margin of 46% against 37% in the first quarter of 2021.
OCP’s investment expenditures, meanwhile, reached MAD 2.98 billion ($295.32 million) in the first quarter of this year against MAD 1.75 billion ($173.43 million) in the same period last year.
The company concluded its statement by emphasizing that it is committed to investing in environmental and social programs to maintain its positive impact on global food security.
Morocco holds over 75% of the world’s reserves of phosphate rock, a key ingredient in fertilizer, and OCP is the world’s largest exporter of phosphate rock. 
As the escalating Ukraine war further stresses the already volatile global food supply chain, many observers expect the Moroccan company to grow in global prominence and influence as governments -- especially in the developing world -- rally to meet the impending food insecurity crisis.

144,Innovation Can Cement Israel and Morocco’s Budding Relationship,"As we transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one, the answer to all these challenges lies in innovation and in our ability to identify opportunities to work together to overcome them. That kind of cooperation cannot be built overnig",Avi Hasson,"May 23, 2022 9:32 a.m.","Though Israel and Morocco share many historical and cultural ties, geopolitical issues have long kept our two nations separate. That changed at the end of 2020 when the two countries began establishing full diplomatic and trade relations.
Since then, embassies have been opened, dozens of G2G MOUs have been signed and direct flights have begun flying on a near-daily basis. What’s still lagging, however, are the business-to-business and people-to-people ties, the kind that will really cement the relationship and transform it from a formal normalization agreement into a genuine warm peace that can benefit all Moroccans and Israelis.
As a 30-year veteran of the Israeli tech industry, having filled a range of roles in both the private and public sectors, I am convinced that innovation is the key to expediting and enhancing our relationship and ensuring mutually beneficial outcomes.
Israel and Morocco may be different in many ways, but what both our countries share is a passion for progress and a belief that advanced technology must be an economic anchor. For Israel, it already is, with technology accounting for more than 50% of its exports, and for Morocco, it is very much a goal — a cornerstone of King Mohammed VI’s New Development Model, which charts the country’s economic path for 2035.
In my experience, the best innovation is a result of finding creative new solutions to significant challenges. The story of the Israeli innovation ecosystem as a whole is one of necessity forcing people to come up with innovative ways to overcome deficiencies or obstacles, whether that is drip irrigation to solve water shortages or the firewall to cope with malicious cyberattacks. For better or worse, Israel and Morocco share many of the same challenges.
Both our countries must cope with a climate that is often hostile to agriculture and food security, we have both been negatively impacted by logistical and supply chain-related concerns, we both seek to secure our future energy needs through transitioning to more sustainable sources, and we both have young and growing populations who we want to ensure can secure employment opportunities in rewarding fields.
As we transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one, the answer to all these challenges lies in innovation and in our ability to identify opportunities to work together to overcome them. That kind of cooperation cannot be built overnight and from behind the desks of government officials, no matter how committed and well-meaning they are. Collaboration of the type I am advocating for needs to be built over time, by trusted partners who identify each other's motivations, capabilities, and pain points, and then seek ways to turn them into real-world solutions.
Fortunately, the similarities I mentioned between Israel and Morocco do not put us on a collision course. Both the geographic distance and the differences between our two economies mean that instead of competing with each other, our countries can complement each other. Nowhere is this potential more apparent than when it comes to human capital.
While Israel has long suffered from a chronic shortage of high-quality personnel for its booming tech industry, Morocco suffers from the opposite problem, a shortage of jobs to meet the needs of its talented college graduates, who often have to seek employment opportunities abroad.  There is every reason to believe that by joining forces and connecting our two tech sectors, we can come up with ways to mitigate each other’s challenges. Similar solutions can be found in the areas of capital investments, research and development, and market access, with each country benefitting from the advantages of the other.
Having worked closely with entrepreneurs for many years, I know that they require two seemingly contradictory forces in order to flourish. On one hand, they need consistency so they build long-term plans and see them out to fruition, and on the other, they need a level of dynamism that can react to the ever-shifting nature of the economy. While the King’s New Development Model provides the former, I believe that infusing it with the characteristically Israeli attributes of agility and risk-taking can provide a formidable boost.
For Israel, Morocco is in many ways a hidden gem, less obvious than our other Abraham Accord partners in terms of market size and opportunity, which means there is more of a chance to make an impact. Israeli technologies introduced to the North African hub can rapidly find their way to the entire continent, opening the door to an often overlooked and undervalued consumer base.
By building a bridge between Israel and Morocco with innovation ties at its foundation, I hope we can also inspire other countries, namely Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria to put aside past differences and recognize the value of working in partnership with the Start-Up Nation.

145,The Almoravid Heritage and Modern Day Moroccan Geostrategy,"The use of history as a means impugn motives with regard to modern legitimate political objectives, namely liberation from Spanish colonialism, seems to be a strangely desperate attempt to swap roles so that the one who seeks liberation becomes the one wi",Lahcen Haddad,"May 17, 2022 1:24 p.m.","Those who interpret Morocco’s geostrategic goals as only the tip of the iceberg of a much larger and hidden political agenda to rebuild the Middle Ages’ Grand Maghrib (The Greater Morocco), which saw its peak during the Almoravids and the Almohads, are merely engaged in a politically calculated process of impugning of motives. The objective is clearly political: to stand in Morocco’s way of legitimizing its liberation of Western Sahara from Spanish Colonialism and its efforts to get back the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla from Spain, as well as thwarting its effort to demarcate its maritime borders in accordance with the provisions of international maritime law. 
The use of history as a means impugn motives with regard to modern legitimate political objectives, namely liberation from Spanish colonialism, seems to be a strangely desperate attempt to swap roles so that the one who seeks liberation becomes the one with undisclosed colonial intentions.   
Yet, that is a blessing in disguise. The proponents of the “expansionist theory” who accuse Morocco of having proto-colonial interests underscore, ironically enough, the North African country’s historically legitimate claim for Western Sahara, because, they, unwillingly, recognize it as having been part and parcel of Moroccan rule and sovereignty since the twelfth century (i.e. approximately ten centuries ago)—as were by the way, Western Algeria, Mauritania, and Al-Andalus.  
Does this mean that Morocco has the right to claim Algeria, Mauritania and Al-Andalus? Of course not. This is not a viable option as these countries, whose sovereignty is internationally recognized, are now independent. Algeria was a province that was for sure under the rule of the Moroccan dynasties of the Almoravids (11th & 12th C.), the Almohads (12th and 13th C.), the Marinids (13th  & 15th C. ), the Wattasids (15th & 16th C.), and of the Ottoman empire for 3 centuries, from 1516 till 1838. It was a French colony for 132 years, from 1830 till 1962 and became an independent and full-fledged country since 1962. Mauritania gained independence in 1960, and Andalusia is a region of Spain since the fall of Granada in 1492. 
As for the Western Sahara, which was liberated by Morocco from the Spanish colonizer in 1975, it has been registered by the North African country on the UN List of Non Self-Governing Territories in 1964. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a resolution on October 16, 1975, stating that, contrary to what Franco was claiming, Western Sahara, was not a terra nullus, and stressing that allegiance bonds linking the Sahrawi populations to the Moroccan kings existed over the centuries. After the signature of the Madrid Accords in 1975 by virtue of which Western Sahara was liberated from Spanish Colonialism and returned to its legitimate people, i.e. the Moroccans, the territory should have been removed from the list of Non self-Governing Territories but, unfortunately, it was not. 
Let us dive into history to see how far this relationship goes. Let us follow the traces of history, zooming in on the Almoravid dynasty to see how the events that took place between 1040-1147 shaped, in an indelible and irreversible manner, how Western Sahara has always already been Moroccan since the Almoravid time. 
The Almoravids first emerged as a reform movement that relied on the unity of the Amazigh Sanhaja tribes, whose territories spread from the Senegal River in the south, passing through the areas of M’Sila, Tri, and Mellah in Algeria, and then to the Atlas and the Rif mountains in Morocco. Afterwards, growing stronger militarily, the movement took control of commercial roads, becoming an Islamic state that stretches from present-day Mauritania, western Algeria, and Morocco, all the way to Al-Andalus and up until the borders of Castile and the Kingdom of Navarre.
In the first quarter of the eleventh century, Yahya ben Ibrahim, leader of the Amazigh Sanhaja confederation –comprised of the Lamtuna (ancestors of the present Sahara inhabitants), Kadala, Gzula and Mesmuda tribes, among others – asked Abdullah Ben Yassin, a student of Waggag Ben Zallu al-Lamti who was stationed in the coastal town of Aglou west of Tiznit, to accompany him to the Sahara and parts of Western Sudan (present-day  Mali and Mauritania, all the way up to Adrar, Twat, Es-Sakia el Hamra and Oued Eddahab,) in order to spread Islam in these areas.
After initial failures, Abdullah Ben Yassin was able to build a strong Ribat (a monastery-like center for the devout, the pious and the pilgrim) on the Senegal River, implementing Sharia laws, including hudud (corporal punishments for fornication, adultery, alcohol drinking, theft and robbery etc.), thereby severely punishing those he thought were astray from his strict understanding of religion. On the other hand, he united the tribes of Lamtuna, Kadala, Masoufa and others, based on a tight organization of faith and on the fundamentals of the Da’wah (Islamic preaching). The jihad initiated by Ben Yassin first led him to the Kingdom of Ghana, where he recaptured Audaghost (present-day eastern Mauritania) and parts of the Niger River. 
Despite the death of Yahya Ben Ibrahim and later Yahya Ben Omar, the Almoravids gained wide acclaim. Hence, under the religious and military command of Ben Yassin, the newly-emerged power in Africa annexed a huge chunk of western Sudan, and expanded from the Senegal River to the south and the Niger River to the east all the way to the south of Oued Noun, passing through Tiris Zemmour, Adrar, Es-Sakia el Hamra, Oued Ed-Dahab, and further north. 
Perhaps the leading event that established Almoravids' control of Maghrib al-Aqsa (present-day Morocco) was the conquest of the Souss region in 445 A.H -1054 AD when Waggag Ben Zallu al-Lamti asked Ben Yassin to help Souss inhabitants put an end to the control of the Zenati Maghrawis. Consequently, a battle took place, ending with Sijilmassa’s fall in the hands of the Almoravids, after which it was “cleansed” of all manifestations of “al-Munkar” (evil deeds), in the light of Ben Yassin’s fundamentalist interpretation of religion.
After controlling Sijilmassa’s uprising against Almoravids' religious intolerance as well as subduing Kadala tribe’s rebellion against the Lamtuna tribesmen’s domination and monopoly of key positions in government, the military commander Abu Bakr bin Omar (who succeeded his brother Yahya) moved to the Souss region in 448 A.H-1056 AD. It was at this period that the military commander Yusuf bin Tashfeen emerged as a potential leader of the Islamic state. He was appointed by Abdullah bin Yassin governor of Sijilmassa. Starting from there, he expanded his territory to include Taroudant, Massa, and Kadala. After capturing the Souss region, the Almoravids headed to Aghmat, where they killed its prince –Lqout Maghraoui– and took over the important city. 
Enjoying one victory after the other, the Almoravids army went to battle against the allegedly heretic Barghwata (who had written their own version of the Qur’an) near Rabat. It was in one of these ferocious battles that the Almoravids lost their great leader Abdullah Ben Yassin in 1059. After receiving allegiance to succeed Ben Yassin as both religious leader and military commander, Abu Bakr took control of Zenata, Miknasa, and Louata, before returning to Aghmat.
Overpopulation in the town of Aghmat prompted the establishment of a new capital, Marrakech. The new city was chosen to be as close as possible to the original tribes of Lamtuna, Kadala and Jazoula (some of which are the ancestors of the present-day Western Sahara tribes, namely the Tekna, Errguibet, Ouled Dlim, Laaroussiyin, Zarguiyyin etc.) and not far from the strongholds of the dissident Maghrawa and Barghawata. 
Abu Baker then led half his army to Lamtuna and Kadala to solve the arousing disputes that were breaking out between the two Sahrawi tribes, while leaving the other half under the command of his cousin Yussef who was supposed to set off from Marrakech as well to quell the revolutions of the rebellious tribes of Zenata and Maghrawa to the north. It was the same army led by Yussef that would later on capture the north and east of Maghrib al-Aqsa, as well as all of Maghrib al-Awsat (present-day Algeria minus the southern Saharan parts ) before conquering Al-Andalus.
The Sahrawi depth of the Moroccan state remained relatively strong during the reign of the Almohads (1121-1269). Yet, the peak of the close attachment between the Moroccan state and the Sahrawi tribes was in the Saadi era (1510-1659), when the dynasty controlled the long strip of land stretching southwards from Twat and Taghaza to Timbuktu, Gao, and Tjini. 
This close connection was further solidified with the Alawi dynasty (beginning in 1666) whose armies penetrated as far as Chenguiti all the way to the Senegal River and beyond to Northern modern-day Senegal. 
However, the frontiers stretching from Oued Noun to Cap Boujdour remained constant and unchanged under the rule of all successive dynasties, including the Marinids and the Wattassids. Throughout history, the strip stretching south to Cap Boujdour and east beyond Tindouf and Twat was part and parcel of the Moroccan Makhzen (Moroccan rule). This depth is the basis of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara, which is a historical, political, cultural, geographical, and geostrategic. The strong bond between Morocco and its African depth, which dates as far back as the Almoravids and stretches over time till the Spanish colonization that started in the 1880s, is the historical sediment of Morocco’s legitimate claim over Western Sahara. It is the essence and the basis of the legitimate presence of Morocco in Western Sahara.

146,"Geography Is Destiny, History is the Will of Nations: Spain and Morocco and the Shared Leap Towards the Future","What distinguishes the relationship between Morocco and Spain is that the time factor (i.e. history), which, when added to geography, both create a destiny of tectonic dimensions.",Lahcen Haddad,"May 09, 2022 10:44 a.m.","Rabat - Readers of the history of relations between Morocco and Spain, over at least thirteen centuries, are fascinated by a vast “body” of events, battles, wars, conquests, colonialism, emancipation in addition to the recently crafted economic, social and cultural overlap. A complex relationship that extends beyond geography and history to the shared present and an ineluctable future governed by the need for coexistence and cohabitation in an extended space that is one of the most geo-strategically sensitive regions of the World.
In his famous speech to the Canadian Senate on 17 May 1961, John Fitzgerald Kennedy told Canadians: "" “Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder. What unites us is far greater than what divides us.”
This statement applies perfectly to Morocco and Spain because as Abraham Verghese, the American writer and physician at Stanford University, said, ""geography is Destiny"". Spain and Morocco not only found themselves embroiled over time in a long and free-wheeling history of invasions, wars, battles, conquests and liberations, but were able since the seventies of the 20th Century to transcended animosity and build a creative model of cooperation, using the maritime borders, the seas and the common view of the Straits of Gibraltar as an opportunity to thrive and prosper together. 
What distinguishes the relationship between Morocco and Spain is that the time factor (i.e. history), which, when added to geography, both create a destiny of tectonic dimensions that concerns what Fernand Braudel, co-founder of the French school of the Annales, the ""long duration"", that is to say the immobile time which transcends generations and events and is part of the slow evolution of peoples in relation to the landscape, geography and ecology (Fernand Braudel, “La longue durée”, Annales, Vol. 13, no 4, 1958.)
If history in its Hegelian sense is an intelligent process and a movement towards a new status or condition, i.e. ""human freedom"" (""Lessons in the Philosophy of History"" 1837), the power of geography is to give an ecological, cultural and political dimension to geostrategic proximity and “untranscendable” “thereness”.
Spain's emancipation from fascism after the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975 and Morocco's liberation from colonial rule from 1956 to 1975, can be seen as a watershed in the history of the two countries and in the history of their relations. The entry of the two countries into the era of “freedom” (freedom from dictatorship for Spain and freedom from colonialisms for Morocco) at the same period accelerated the use of geography as a gateway to cooperation and partnership.
History evolves according to a certain momentum that coalesces events that are controlled by the actors and others that are part of the inevitable process of things both human and natural, creating a structural transformation that turns things upside down. This change, in the case of Morocco and Spain, occurred in this period of parallel emancipation (from dictatorship and colonialism), which was a milestone in the history of the two countries and a milestone in the history of their relations. 
Over the past 40 years, relations have developed in such a way that Spain has become Morocco's leading trade partner (ahead of France, which remains Morocco's leading economic partner); Morocco has become Spain's leading trade partner in Africa, the turnover of trade between the two countries amounts to € 16 billion; the number of Spanish companies operating in Morocco exceeds 1,000; Moroccan tourism in Spain generates approximately € 1 billion; and the value of Spanish tourism in Morocco can be estimated at around € 1.2 billion. Three million Moroccans residing abroad cross Spain every year to go back to Morocco, contributing thereby around € 1 billion to the Spanish economy; not to mention the 700,000 Moroccans residing in Spain, who take part in building the Spanish economy, while transferring part of their income to their families in Morocco.
At the security level, dozens of terrorist cells have been dismantled in Spain and Morocco, as a result of the exemplary cooperation between the security forces of both countries; exchange of information and joint operations, added to cooperation with third countries, has been instrumental in the fight against terrorism, extremism, organized and cross-border crime. 
Tens of thousands of immigration attempts have been thwarted by Moroccan security services. Uncurbed migration attempts here and there should not obscure Morocco's efforts to protect its borders and those of Europe from illegal migration. The cost of such an endeavor is around half a billion euros a year, with help from the EU that does not exceed a total of € 300 million since 2006, a mere € 18 million a year.
There are those who want to weave another story, a narrative of a different and alternative kind. They are the Podemos and the Spanish far left, who support the separatist thesis of the Polisario, in addition to some disgruntled journalists who still cling to the myth of an Algerian revolution and its enfant terrible, the “Polisario revolution in the sand.” They still blame Morocco for the victory of Mohamed Ben Abdelkarim Al-Khattabi in the battle of Anwal in the summer of 1921 and consider the Moroccans who participated with Franco in his war against the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) as a fifth column mobilized by Morocco (who was by the way, ironically enough, colonized then by both France and Spain) to help Spanish fascism. They also see the Green March (1975) as Moroccan blackmail of Spain while Franco was in bed dying, which led to the removal of the Sahara from Spain at a time of political and constitutional weakness. 
For all this, they conclude that Algeria and the Polisario front should be supported and Morocco weakened; they applaud the creation of a permanent tension with the “backward” and fundamentally undemocratic country of Morocco; “they are moros, anayway!”
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's announcement that Morocco's autonomy proposal was the most serious, realistic and credible basis for resolving the Sahara conflict has been a mortal blow to this narrative. The response was therefore violent from opponents of the Moroccan-Spanish rapprochement. They see the realism of the Spanish position as a development that will most certainly weaken their thesis. They were betting on the continuation of tensions between the two countries, a situation that would bring Spain closer to Algeria and accelerate the dream of an independent state in the Moroccan Sahara.
However, the Establishment in Spain (including the Army and the security apparatuses), the private sector, along with the Governments at both national and local levels, see in the relaunch of strategic relations between the two countries not only an investment in the future, in the security of Europe, in the prosperity of Ceuta and Melilla (the occupied Moroccan cities), the Canary Islands, Andalusia and others, but a normalization that is in harmony with the history and power of geography to embody the Spanish-Moroccan dream--the dream of an extended space for economic integration, security cooperation and the common development of the two countries' maritime and natural assets. The dream of the two peoples for prosperity and sustained growth in a promising and welcoming space of security and stability triumphed. Hope won over apathy and pessimism.

147,Does the Fertilizer Industry Need a Morocco-Led OPEC Alternative?,"With a volatile market for both fertilizer and its inputs, Morocco and other fertilizer-producing countries could unite to stabilize the market.",Jasper Hamann,"May 07, 2022 6:07 p.m.","Rabat - As the global economy goes through a turbulent period marked by a worldwide scramble for fertilizers and their ingredients, Morocco and other key producers could benefit from an OPEC-style alliance to stabilize global prices. 
The global market for fertilizers is undergoing severe disruptions, first caused by global supply-chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then worsened by the conflict in Ukraine. With key supplies of inputs and fertilizer itself under threat, governments around the world are scrambling to find new supplies of this important commodity.
Fertilizers are a key element in ensuring global food security, and have led to a vast population increase worldwide that now depend on it to maintain affordable food prices. 
The impact of the global fertilizer market on food prices for consumers has become a frontpage issue in recent months, in particular after the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, two key suppliers of both agricultural output such as wheat, and the chemicals required to make fertilizers.
Price volatility
Fertilizers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, often tailored to the specific soil and crop available to farmers. From corporate potato farmers in France to small-scale coffee plantations in Indonesia, everyone needs a regular supply of fertilizers in order to grow their crops.
Some countries have resorted to drastic measures to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers in recent years. Sri Lanka is a prime example. 
The country decided to opt for an approach that would demand the use of organic fertilizers, yet the measure has brought a myriad of issues, including difficulties sourcing reliable organic material, while local farmers and experts worry about future yields. 
Most countries recognize that there is little choice in the matter. Current population levels require chemical fertilizers, and governments are often blamed when fertilizer supplies run dry. 
India is a fine example of the political implications of fertilizer shortages. The South Asian country’s political scene regularly turns into a circular firing squad whenever farmers complain about fertilizer prices. Local politicians blame the national government, experts blame economists, while local farmers are left bewildered and angry.
Amid fluctuating prices, COVID-19 disruptions and concerns over Eastern European supplies, the fertilizer market is set to continue to see rising prices, likely for years to come.
Essential resource
While our global economic system generally prefers to depend on the free market to correct prices based on supply and demand, the importance of a stable fertilizer supply leads many countries to introduce vast domestic subsidy-schemes in order to keep fertilizers affordable.
The vital importance of fertilizers to people around the world could lead to calls to find a more structural solution to market volatility. Just as with the most traded commodity on earth, oil, fertilizer supplies are essential to keep our modern world going.
Based on this primary need, fertilizer-producing countries like Morocco could be facing a unique opportunity, where the global importance of their industry is recognized like no time before.
These countries could take inspiration from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the stabilizing impact it has had on global oil markets. This alliance of oil-producing countries is able to control global oil prices by using its vast spare capacity to either increase or decrease production.
While OPEC remains controversial in times of high oil prices, few experts would discount the stabilizing effect the intergovernmental organization has had on global markets. While commentators might lament when the organization chooses not to use its power, few other resources have the available option to swiftly change the balance of supply and demand.
OFEC?
At a time when fertilizer supplies are a genuine threat to global food security, impacting consumers around the world, fertilizer-producing countries could step in to bring a sense of stability to the market. 
Similar to the model of OPEC, Morocco and other key producers could band together, and leverage their control over the supply of fertilizers to keep this valuable resource available to farmers around the globe.
Such an organization could help ensure a steady supply of fertilizers, stabilize prices at a sustainable level, and alleviate worries over a supply crunch that could leave millions facing malnutrition or starvation.
Such an organization could negate the current, desperate scramble for fertilizer supplies that has led to countries such as Brazil to skirt sanctions amid a search for potential new suppliers. It could bring together key producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers in the US, China, and India with key phosphate-rich countries such as Morocco.
Morocco in particular could be a potential leader of such a new organization, as it holds over 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves.
OPEC’s stabilizing effects are one reason why its cartel-like practices are generally accepted. Another reason is its unique symbiotic relationship with the US. 
With governments around the world currently seeing the importance of their fertilizer supply, and the possible political ramifications of shortages, such a symbiosis between fertilizer producers and consumers could suddenly emerge like never before.
Benefits for Morocco
If Morocco and others chose to step in to bring down fertilizer prices and ensure steady supplies, the effects of a more stable market would benefit a range of stakeholders, from end-consumers to the farmers who produce our food.
Morocco’s vast reserves could guarantee the country a significant role in such an organization due to its unmatched reserves and its geopolitical position between Europe, Africa, and the Arab world. 
Morocco’s current focus on sustainability in its New Development Model, as well as its climate commitments, could provide another key benefit: the exchange of agricultural technology and knowledge. Africa in particular has vast arable land, yet often lacks the investment and knowledge to increase yields and incomes for farmers.
A collaborative alliance of key producers of fertilizers and their inputs could help direct much-needed funds toward capacity-building efforts and knowledge exchange, while ensuring farmers and their consumers do not fall victim to market volatility. 
Based on the current context of instability and uncertainty, Morocco could leverage its diplomatic and economic resources to work towards a stable future-proof fertilizer market. 
With prices at record highs, the current context could provide a unique moment when international needs could overrule potential fears of the future power of such an organization.

148,Midwives Save Lives and a Central Component of Health Systems,"When pregnant women in war torn areas cannot access health centers, midwives like Laila travel to remote areas and provide professional reproductive care services.",Luay Shabaneh,"May 06, 2022 10:16 a.m.","Laila, a Yemeni midwife from Abyan, had to walk for more than an hour after midnight in a dangerous journey to attend to a delivery in a neighborhood that was under attack: “This is what midwives do in such dangerous environment, they put their lives at risk to save other’s’ lives.” she said.
When Laila began to attend to the delivery, an airstrike hit right next to the house. The whole house shook. The woman who was about to give birth, panicked and tried to escape despite her suffering and pain, but the brave midwife managed the situation, calmed her down and ensured the safe delivery of a healthy baby.  
When pregnant women in war torn areas cannot access health centers, midwives like Laila travel to remote areas and provide professional reproductive care services. We should always recognize and appreciate midwives' contributions and bravery. This cadre of primary health care providers plays a pivotal role in decreasing maternal mortality particularly in humanitarian settings. 
Every pregnant woman deserves a safe delivery, and midwives are capable of providing this care, saving lives in the process. Giving birth safely, comfortably and conveniently at home or in clinics should not be a luxury, but a woman’s basic human right. Therefore, midwife-led reproductive and maternal care should be considered a central component of all health systems at all times, especially during emergencies and in situations of fragility. 
Midwives also serve as agents of change at the community level with high potential to effect positive behaviour change; they provide advice, care and support for women and their babies during pregnancy, labour and the early postnatal period. Moreover, they educate, empower and enable women to lead healthy lives and exercise their right to sexual and reproductive health.
Yet the Arab region has a shortage of 128,000 midwives, and hundreds of thousands of women and newborns continue to die each year during pregnancy and childbirth due to preventable complications and illnesses. These can be prevented if midwives are empowered and trained to provide proper antenatal, delivery and post-natal care services.  A recent study from 88 countries that account for the vast majority of the world’s maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirths concluded that universal coverage of midwife-delivered interventions could avert two-thirds of these deaths and save 4.3 million lives per year by 2035.
Every day, midwives stand by women when they are most vulnerable, they often risk their own lives to save pregnant women and newborns, they operate in different settings and during the toughest circumstances and are always on the frontlines to support childbearing women in order to ensure safe and healthy pregnancies, taking every precaution to protect the women they serve. However, they are often not included in emergency preparedness and response planning.
Midwives must be included in the national emergency preparedness planning, to ensure that midwifery is not overlooked when responding to crises and disasters. It is also essential for education and training curricula to include the provision of effective reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) care in a crisis.
Despite their role in the fight for the rights of women, children and communities, midwives often deprived of their own rights: to rest and self-care, to decent work and pay, and protection from discrimination. To achieve their full life-saving, health-improving, system-strengthening potential, midwives must be well educated, adequately trained, and appropriately regulated. They must also work in an environment that enables them to be effective.

149,Beware the Drums of War Echoing Through the Halls of Democracy,"The Ukraine conflict is being presented as a struggle of liberal democracies versus the rest of the world, resulting in calls for rapid escalation and confrontation.",Jasper Hamann,"Apr. 22, 2022 11:59 a.m.","Rabat - As someone who has spent the last few years living happily in Morocco, I finally briefly returned to Europe last week, where I was shocked to see the near-universal panic and push for war related to the Ukraine conflict. 
In the media, politics, and popular opinion, one narrative appears to be universally accepted, that the Russian offensive in Ukraine constitutes an imminent and clear threat to the current world order; democracy itself is being attacked and needs urgent intervention.
This has resulted in strange political trends. In the US the right-wing of the political sphere is pushing the center-left administration into further escalation and military action, while in the UK, the center-left  is pushing the right-wing administration to do the same. “The government is not doing enough against Putin’s aggression,” is the criticism shared by both US Republicans, and the UK Labour party alike, making for some very unlikely bedfellows.
An eerie consensus
Beautifully documented by American journalist Michael Tracy in a recent piece, democratic opposition parties across the West near-universally agree that the government is not doing enough, and call for further military action to cripple Russia once and for all.
Ironically, in western democracies, the anti-war narrative has become a narrative that calls for more direct military action, for vastly increased military spending and for flooding eastern Europe with advanced Western weaponry to support the Ukrainian resistance.
High-level officials in the UK have called for NATO to intervene directly by setting up a naval blockade to defend the Ukrainian port-city of Odessa. Meanwhile, many in the US press and political scene continue to call for the establishment of a “no fly zone” over Ukraine.
What these fairly abstract military terms really mean, few expand upon. Because a NATO naval blockade, or a no-fly zone, both imply that NATO forces would actively engage in combat with Russian military assets, by shooting down Russian planes, or attacking Russian navy vessels.
Throwing caution to the wind
What shocked me most during my brief time in Europe, is the growing consensus that it might be worth risking a possible third world war, in order to “teach Putin a lesson.” Russia’s incursion is being presented as a direct threat to democracies worldwide, which then turns into the conclusion that democracies must unite and urgently fight back.
The existential terms in which the renewed fighting in Ukraine are being presented stand in stark contrast to earlier Russian misdeeds against its neighbors. The fact that Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, or annexed Crimea in 2014, somehow did not meet this standard. 
Yet now the drums of war are emanating from every direction in the “free west.” The countries that promote freedom of speech and the open debate of ideas appear now to have produced a near universal consensus on the war, and any nuanced counter-arguments are quickly dismissed as “pro-Putin.”
From comedy shows to the evening news, the calls for a direct clash with nuclear-armed Russia are not just accepted, many seem to agree that democracies should have engaged in this clash much earlier. 
A threat to democracy?
When I tell my Moroccan friends or colleagues about the European consensus on Russia as an existential threat to democracy, many either smile or scoff.
After all, Morocco’s geopolitical “neighborhood,” has seen democracies tumble and creak over the past years. Since August 2019, West-Africa has seen six coup attempts, four of which successful, and two occurring in the same country. 
Democracies in the region have been regularly overthrown at gunpoint, yet few in the West have presented it as even a fraction as relevant as the conflict in Ukraine to the “rules based order” led by Western democracies. 
Ironically, it was the Western intervention in Libya that made possible many of the current coup attempts. 
The attempts to overthrow Muamar Ghaddafi and establish a new democracy in Libya led to the country being flooded with Western-funded weapons, while NATO airplanes assisted in crushing the Libyan air force. The aftermath of Ghaddafi’s swift overthrow however, constitutes what the CIA calls “blowback,” the unintended consequences of military intervention.
Small arms and well-trained fighters flooded into the Sahel and West-Africa, arms intended for Libyan fighters against Ghaddafi became the guns pointed at the heads of African democracies.
Blowback
The horrific consequences of a possible direct military confrontation between the “free West” and Russia cannot be underestimated, yet even the current military support for the Ukrainian resistance could constitute a greater threat to democracies than Russia ever could be.
What happens to the thousands of weapons being sent to Ukraine once this conflict inevitably dies down? And what happens to the thousands of experienced and trained fighters who will find themselves unemployed and potentially destitute after the silencing of the guns in Ukraine?
What is likely to occur, based on the patterns of recent history, is that those weapons will flow south, and create a new flint that could spark civil war and coup attempts far away from Europe’s borders. From politically unstable Lebanon to insurgents in Nigeria, a new influx of fighters and advanced weaponry could itself result in the crumbling of democracies.
When I have asked Europeans to look into what their countries have done, or could have done better, to prevent the current potentially apocalyptic stand-off with Russia, many appear flummoxed. The problem is the inherent evilness and war-hunger of Putin and the Russians, and democracies are simply responding to this threat, is the common response.
Deescalation
Yet few recognize that the only way to “influence” Russia’s part in the conflict is through potentially world-devastating war. Investigating what democracies can do to de-escalate the conflict and prevent another future stand-off is actually within the control of citizens of free democracies, and could result in a sustainable peace.
While the consequences of the current mindset in the democracies of the “rules based order” are uncertain, the current conflict is certainly a threat to democracy and stability. 
The irony is that it is not democracy in London or Washington that is under threat. The blow to democratic ideals incurred by this conflict are more likely to be felt in Beirut, Addis Ababa or Abuja. 
When the refugees of those potential conflicts arrive at Europe’s borders, will they be seen as victims of the struggle to protect democracy, and will they be received as Ukrainian refugees have been? 
In order to prevent such a calamity, a key role can be played by the group of countries who have not picked a side in the Ukraine conflict, the countries that are being depicted as an alliance of authoritarians by Western media and politicians. 
Those countries could call on the world to treat the Ukraine conflict as if it were a conflict between brown people, when the West seems to be able to be more neutral and devoid of emotion. In that case we could use the UN’s vast array of conflict-resolution mechanisms to stop the fighting, disarm irregular combatants, and establish a negotiated peace.
The question is whether we have already gone too far over the precipice, where deescalation is seen as defeat, and negotiations are seen as a missed chance to punish Russia once and for all. Only time will tell if calmer heads and nuanced solutions will prevail. For all our sakes, let's hope that they will.

150,Spanish Media and the Bankruptcy of the Anti-Moroccan Narrative,Spain’s change of heart on Western Sahara symbolizes the unraveling of hostile narratives targeting Morocco,Lahcen Haddad,"Apr. 15, 2022 10:49 a.m.","The decision by the Spanish Government on March 18, 2022 to recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara and declare the Autonomy Plan proposed by Morocco to be credible and a solid basis for a solution to the Western Sahara conflict angered quite a few journalists and media outlets in Spain.
It is surprising that these opinion leaders should be against peace and a win/win solution in the Sahara and against a normalization of relations between Spain and its southern neighbor with whom it shares borders, seas, history, geography, a booming trade, millions of tourists, investments, security concerns, migration headaches, resident and transiting migrant workers etc.
It is strange that some Spanish media and journalists do not see the benefits of a partnership of peace and prosperity between Spain and Morocco. They seem to revel when the tension was at its height over the last few months, especially since the (not so) secret admission to Spain of Morocco’s enemy Number One, Brahim Ghali, who happens to be accused of genocide and crimes against humanity by Sahrawis living in Tindouf, Moroccan Sahara and Spain.
We need to dig deeper to understand why some Spanish media and journalists prefer tension over peace, partnership and good neighborhood relations between Spain and Morocco. The anti-Moroccan reflex of these opinion leaders comes from an atavistic anti-Moorish attitude that has sedimented in the psyche of some Spaniards over the centuries, since the Muslim conquest (in the 8th Century) and up till La Reconquista (13th -15th Centuries). But this resentment resurged with force after the debacle of the Spanish Army at the hands of the guerrilla forces of Mohamed Ben Abdelkrim El Kahttabi in the “Annual” Battle in July-August 1921.
Quite a few Spaniards see it as a form of humiliation but rare are those who see it as a liberation act led by indigenous Moroccan tribes against a colonial force that nobody invited to occupy the northern part of the Charifian Kingdom. “Annual” still resonates in the psyche of so many of these opinion leaders as a sign of Morocco’s untrustworthiness and treachery, repeating the same colonial dogma of “ungrateful indigenous populations” biting the civilizing hand of colonialism.

Fifteen years later, the Spanish civil war broke out. Francisco Franco had crossed from Northern Morocco to Spain to fight Spanish republicans, helped by Moroccan mercenaries who joined his army for pure economic reasons; these individuals acted alone knowing that they could earn more as soldiers than as laborers. Some Spaniards still think that Morocco helped Franco win and therefore abort the victory of the democratic forces against fascism.
Very few would want to admit that at that time Morocco was colonized by the French and the Spanish, did not have any army, and the role of the Sultan (the King) was merely symbolic with no powers whatsoever. But it is a convenient narrative; it fits within the grand picture of Morocco as a scheming foe trying to undo Spanish sovereign nation-building aspirations.
On October 16, 1975, the International Court of Justice ruled that there were legal ties (of allegiance) between Western Sahara and Morocco. The same day, Hassan II called for Moroccans to organize a peaceful march towards Western Sahara to put an end to Spanish colonialism. At that very time, Franco was in bed agonizing leaving a vacuum of power, since as a dictator he had centralized all the powers of decision within the Spanish state. Spanish anti-Moroccan opinion leaders cried and are still crying wolf: “Morocco used Franco’s agony to humiliate Spain;” “Spain would never leave Western Sahara had Franco not been in his death bed;” “Morocco is at it again trying to build the Grand Maghrib of the Middle Ages;” “Morocco’s blackmail of Spain is at work again” etc.
A pure coincidence of events was turned into a narrative of blackmail and treachery. Nobody among these has ever mentioned that documents and testimonies showed that Franco was ready to negotiate the retrocession of Western Sahara to Morocco at the time of the Left-wing Government of Abdallah Ibrahim (December 24 1958- May 21, 1960) but internal tensions and truf wars between the then Crown Prince (who became King Hassan II in February 26, 1961) and the National Movement and calculations as to who will reap the benefits of such a liberation of the Sahara came in the way and prevented a deal when Franco was in good health.
The retrocession of by Spain of Terfaya in1958, of Sidi-Ifni in 1969, the fact that Morocco was the first to register Western Sahara as a self-non governing territory with the UN Commission on Decolonization in 1963-4 do not matter if the intention is to paint Spain as “the good guy” and Morocco as the “bad guy”, as in a historical cheap and sentimental melodrama. None of the Spanish media cared to mention the attacks of the Moroccan Liberation Army (MLA) in 1957-58 on regions in Western Sahara which led to a joint operation by French and Spanish armies called “Ecouvillon” in February 1958 whose mission was to thwart the advance of the MLA. It just does not fit within the grand scheme of the Moroccan conspiracy against Spain.
Nobody has ever even mentioned that the Polisario was formed by Sahrawi students in Rabat in 1971-1972 in Rabat. El-Ouali Moustapha Sayed and his friends were dreaming of the Western Sahara being liberated as a Moroccan territory; they contacted political party leaders (especially the Nationalist Movement and leftwing parties) but were completely scorned off by the latter.
In June 1972, they marched in TanTan to claim the Moroccanness of the Sahara and were brutally repressed by the security forces at the time of General Oufkir’s stronghold on security apparatuses as Minister of Interior. Faithful to his Nasserite Arab nationalist dreams, Hassan II’s nemesis, Muammar Gaddafi, who was adamant about toppling the Moroccan monarchy, heard of them and invited them to Tripoli. Encouraged, armed and funded by Gaddafi, the Polisario became an independence movement way after its first congress in Ain Ben Tili, a small village-fort in northeast Mauritania, part the Tiris Zemmour region, on May 10, 1973.
Algeria did not come into the picture till after the Green March and when it saw that the Polisario had arms, logistical support and organizational capability, all lavishly provided for by Colonel Gaddafi. None of these details matter to the above-mentioned Spanish opinion leaders’ selective and anti-Moroccan approach to the Western Sahara question. The narrative is nicely woven to picture Morocco as blackmailer and Spain as a victim. This is usual colonial rhetoric at its best where a reversal of roles is always a recourse to justify the colonial act: the colonizer becomes a victim and the colonized the oppressor.

The fact that Algeria became party to the conflict despite Algerian President Haouari Boumedienne’s recorded assurances in October 1974, at the occasion of the Arab Summit in Rabat, that Western Sahara is a Moroccan-Mauritanian issue, is so convenient for the anti-Moroccan rhetoric of some Spanish media and opinion leaders. Algeria was considered then by the European and Spanish Left and opinion leaders to be a progressive country embarking upon an agrarian revolution, autonomous management (à la Tito) and state-of-the-art industrialization.
The Algerian Revolution was delivering on its revolutionary promises. Morocco, on the contrary, was backwards, tyrannical and monarchic (i.e. old school) anyway. While Algeria was showered with praise and adoration, Morocco was bombarded with criticism and patronizing political rhetoric. The Polisario became a darling of Spanish and European left-wing media and militants because it symbolized an “Algerian Revolution in the Sands.” The revolutionary romanticism in support of Algeria and the Polisario rimed beautifully with the struggle against the remnants of Spanish fascism as embodied in the successive aborted coups of elements of the Spanish Army against the fledgling democracy.
When the Algerian Revolution turned later against its children and the Agrarian Reform as well as the Industrialization program became mere mirages and even nightmares that resulted in a bloody civil war in the nineties and the military strong grip on the institutional landscape, Spanish (and with them some European) opinion leaders put Algeria in the backburner and concentrated on attacking Morocco. The Polisario’s bleak human rights record, its embezzlement of humanitarian aid, its use of child soldiers, its illegal administration of the Tindouf Camps, and Algeria’s refusal to count and to identify the Sahrawi “refugees” (which Morocco considers Moroccans held against their will) on its territory should not matter, if Morocco is shown under a bad day.
What disturbs them is the striking economic and political advances in Morocco: the economy has tripled in 20 years; poverty was reduced to less than 3 per cent; Morocco is the second investor in Africa; infrastructure programs are transforming the connectivity landscape; mega projects are ushering in a new era of regional leadership; the Parliament is becoming more critical of government and accountability is working; notable advances on the human rights front… “How come”? “The Monarchical system is delivering in Morocco whereas the memory of the Algerian Revolution is bringing forth the worst in the Algerian Establishment.” “Something is wrong!” “It can’t be!”
“Eureka! Eureka!” “We found it!” Morocco is not really developing its economy and improving the livelihood of its people, but is malevolently trying to recreate the Grand Morocco of the Middle Ages that stretches all the way from the Senegal River, and includes Southern and Western Algeria, Western Sahara, Northern Morocco, Andalucía, all the way to the southern borders of Leon, Navarre and Castile.” A grand scheme indeed. For quite a few Spanish opinion leaders, “that is why some Moroccans still consider Mauritania and Eastern Sahara Moroccan Provinces, and why all Moroccans are unanimous on annexing Western Sahara and getting back Ceuta and Melilla, and why the Parliament has voted a law in 2018 to delimit maritime borders that may go beyond the Canary Islands.”
It all fits in. The picture is complete. But the change is interesting: from combating a backward country led by a traditional monarchy, while the alternative is there in the Algerian Revolution and its promises, to preserving Spanish sovereignty from a beguiling foe that has shown in the distant past (Middle Ages) and not so distant past (Annual, the Spanish Civil War and the Green March) that it could harm the very fabric of the Spanish nation.
Homi Bhabha talks of “nation and narration”; here, Spanish opinion leaders create an imaginary narrative of an imaginary foe to fend off an imaginary threat to the nation. Students of conspiracy theories understand well this shift: Jaron Harambam and Stef Aupers called it the movement from the “unbelievable” to the “undeniable” (""From the Unbelievable to the Undeniable: Epistemological Pluralism, or How Conspiracy Theorists Legitimate their Extraordinary Truth Claims"". European Journal of Cultural Studies. SAGE Publications. 24 (4): 990–1008). It is not about the truthfulness of whether Morocco is conspiring to recreate the Grand Morocco but everything fits in a perfect scheme since Annual (July-August 1921) up till the “migration blackmail of Ceuta of May 2021”, 100 years later. The stretch is unbelievable but the truth is undeniable.
Therefore, the tension with Morocco after the strange and “film noir” admission of the notorious Brahim Ghali into Spain was welcome by the anti-Moroccan media and opinion leaders in Spain. Continuous tension will prove that Morocco is always in a blackmail logic, will thwart any attempt to make Morocco and Spain politically agree on geostrategic issues like the Western Sahara, maritime borders and Ceuta and Melilla, because there is no end as to what Morocco, who revels in an expansionist existential state of mind, would ask. Tension will keep Morocco at bay, will delay a permanent denouement and normalization of relations; in the meantime, good relations with Algeria and the Polisario will help keep the conflict in Western Sahara aflame and Morocco busy and weak; and if Western Sahara becomes independent, so much the better, because Morocco will be contained and reduced to a more manageable size.
The Spanish Government’s decision to recognize the sovereignty of Morocco over Western Sahara pulverized this nicely woven and conspiracy-based narrative. Political dialogue with Morocco is possible; partnership could be hoisted to higher levels; trade with Ceuta and Melilla will reopen; Andalusia will continue to benefit from high end tourism on the part of affluent Moroccan tourists; more than a thousand Spanish firms will continue to make money in Morocco; more than three million Moroccans will continue to cross Spain to come back home in the summer. And more than 700 thousand Moroccans will continue to help with rebuilding the Spanish economy after years of slow growth.
This is too much for doomsayers who prefer animosity and tension over good neighborhood and mutually beneficial partnership. It is true that their narrative has been debunked by the forces of the future on both sides of the Gibraltar Straits but more should be done so that this process is ineluctably irreversible. Hope is the best antidote not only to atavistic anti-Moroccanism but is the best we could do to generations on both banks of the Mediterranean who aspire for peace in a world ridden with the plagues of war, strife and terror. The antidote to tacit anti-“moros” racism, covert bigotry, fear of the other is hope, shared prosperity and long-lasting peace.

151,Morocco's Generational Divide on Full Display at BBC Recording,"When it comes to perceptions on freedom of speech in Morocco, the old and young see things very differently",Jasper Hamann,"Apr. 07, 2022 3:06 p.m.","Rabat - On the night of April 6 a mixed crowd of Anglophone Moroccans and expats gathered in Rabat for a panel discussion hosted by British broadcaster the BBC and the British Council. Hosted by veteran reporter Jonny Dymond at the glamorous Hassan Tower Hotel in Rabat, a panel of four Moroccan  experts provided a lively discussion about Morocco’s future. 
Yet one issue in particular appeared to unite the panel, while noticeably dividing the audience: freedom of speech in Morocco.
Earlier, the panel had discussed topics such as drought and desalination, gender issues, political engagement and other hot topics vital to Morocco’s future. Each topic elicited a variety of opinions from the panel, made up of USFP politician Khaoula Lachguar, civil society actor Manal Elattir, former government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi and current Minister Younes Sekkouri.
While all topics drew a relatively muted response from the audience, the topic of freedom of speech in Morocco appeared to truly energize the crowd after over an hour of polite debate. 
Freedom of speech: progress or problem?
The BBC’s format for the discussion dictated that an audience-member ask the panel a question to start discussion on each topic. When it came to freedom of speech, a young Moroccan man mentioned that he continued to face legal action over a three-year old Facebook post in which he had criticized the government.
The young man’s question silenced the audience, while the panel responded by highlighting the progress made on the topic over the past three decades, while all panelists seemed to agree that the issue of freedom of speech was not a main concern in Morocco.
For the first time in the evening, the remarks sparked a strong reaction from the crowd, as a large number of young people raised their hand to speak on the issue. 
What followed was a flurry of responses that highlighted a lingering divide between the perspective of mainstream politicians and those of many well-educated urban young Moroccans. 
One person stood up to mention that many young Moroccans see leaving the country as their only hope, while others shared their opinions and feelings on what they clearly saw as a hot-button issue in Moroccan society.
The uniformity of the panel’s response on the issue contrasted with the vibrant and emotional reactions shared by primarily young Moroccans who expressed feeling alienated and oppressed by the current status quo on freedom of speech and its effect on the country’s media and public dialogue.
The panel discussion, which will be broadcast on the BBC World Service on April 9, is likely to spark further debate on the issue among its millions of listeners, and Moroccans in particular.
Generational divide
The jolt of energy that ran through the audience last night to me reveals a lingering disconnect between Morocco’s mainstream political class and particularly educated urban youth. 
Like everywhere else in the world, young urban professionals and students represent the most progressive individuals in society, often contrasting wildly with the opinions of more conservative rural communities. In Morocco, the sub-group of Anglophone Moroccans likely represent the most progressive ideals even among the country’s urban youth.
Yet this global phenomenon appears to not fully explain last night’s disagreement, revealing an unspoken generational divide in Moroccan society.
This divide in many ways is logical. For older Moroccans, the current status quo on freedom of speech is a breath of fresh air and an unprecedented level of freedom compared to the “years of lead,” a time period of state repression that lasted for decades, and still lingers in the minds of many who experienced it.
While older Moroccans compare Morocco’s current levels of freedom of speech to those difficult years, younger  -especially internationally-minded- Moroccans instead compare the issue to the situation in the more mature democracies of many Western states.
Mending the divide
As a Westerner myself, I would like to emphasize that even in the most liberal countries, the idea of full freedom of speech is also still more of an ideal than a reality. 
The political concept of the “overton window” neatly explains the metaphorical window in which ideas in the West are determined to be either realistic or radical, a key indicator whether a new idea has any chance of being taken seriously by national politicians. 
A key difference between the West’s approach and the issue highlighted by young Moroccans during last night’s BBC event, is that espousing “radical” ideas in the West rarely means facing legal repercussions from the state.
Western states can prosecute speech, and do so for similar reasons as in Morocco, namely speech that is deemed a threat to society or risks violence. 
The issue with Morocco appears to be that it simply defines “threats” differently. And in my opinion, this assessment is based on an outdated perception of Morocco’s internal stability.
Free speech, a threat or an asset?
Morocco is genuinely developing and improving, both internally and on the international stage. The country’s growing prosperity and continued political stability means the country no longer needs to fear threats as much, especially the “threat” of public discontent.
No democracy has a citizenry that fully agrees on all topics, or supports all of the government’s policies. In many ways, opposition and critique to government policies drives positive change, pushes politicians to explain their ideas and builds a feeling of a shared project between citizen and government. 
The irony is that Moroccan politicians do not have to fear the public, or their opinions. 
Vast national efforts to expand social support and healthcare are set to solidify the social contract in the long-term. In the short-term, the new government has the opportunity to revolutionize its public communication and display its ability to discuss strong critiques, present data and elaborate on plans without feeling threatened by diverging opinions.
It is a sense of self-confidence in Morocco’s mission and vision that should empower politicians to embrace intense public debate. Citizens do not expect that the government obeys them, they simply need to feel that their voices are heard, and considered in the public debate.
Morocco’s strong response to COVID-19 and its positive outlook for a sustainable economic recovery should empower Moroccan politicians to welcome dissent and value critics in order to gradually remove the government’s fear of opposing opinions. 
These efforts in turn can remove feelings of repression among the public and build confidence that Morocco’s future is in all of our hands.
Listening to critique does not present a weakness, it instead shows the strength and resilience of Moroccan society and its unique multicultural and international values. 
In the end, we all share both rights and responsibilities in making sure there is a bright future for everyone living in Morocco. That future is possible, and simply requires us to trust in one another, and welcome dissenting opinions as a valuable and patriotic contribution towards our shared project of improving and defending the country we love.
The full panel discussion of the BBC World Questions series is set to be broadcast on the BBC World Service on April 9, after which it can be streamed online.

152,"Sahara: Spain’s Endorsement of Morocco Is a Moment of Truth for EU, France",Spain’s newly-announced position on the Sahara conflict has given renewed vigor to the increasingly prevailing notion that Morocco’s plan is the best route to a lasting solution.,Samir Bennis,"Apr. 05, 2022 10:54 a.m.","Washington DC - Whichever way you slice it, the Spanish decision to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara constitutes the most critical of all the recent diplomatic and political developments on the Sahara question. 
In addition to being of great, unprecedented historical importance -- this being the first time that a European country has supported the Moroccan settlement plan with such clarity and frankness -- the move will have significant geostrategic implications for the future of the conflict.   
That Spain was the occupying state of the Moroccan Sahara until 1975; that it signed an accord with Morocco in which it agreed to return the Sahara to its mother country; and that it never vetoed this agreement makes Madrid’s newfound position particularly important and an even greater boost to the Moroccan position.  
Meanwhile, it goes without saying that, for Algeria, the Spanish decision is a disastrous development for two umbilically linked reasons. First, Madrid’s support for Rabat is a painful reminder of the failure of Algerian diplomat’s tireless efforts to sabotage or at least contain the undeniably pro-Moroccan momentum Western Sahara-related diplomacy has witnessed in the past decade. 
Second, not only as Algeria lost in Spain an erstwhile accomplice with which it used to collude to undermine Moroccan interests, but the domino effect the Spanish decision is sure to set in motion constitutes a devastating blow to Algeria’s dreams of regional hegemony.
A sign of things to come
While the Algerian regime might have failed to foresee the calamitous ramifications of its ill-advised decision to terminate the contract of the Europe-Maghreb pipeline, Algerian diplomats should at least be discerning enough to know that Madrid’s siding with Rabat is the harbinger of more similar things to come. 
If nothing else, the Spanish decision will push many countries, especially in Europe and Latin America, to think of following in Spain’s footsteps. In particular, the move is sure to put unprecedented diplomatic pressure on France, the other country with historical responsibility in the genesis of the Sahara conflict.
Although France has been supporting the Moroccan proposal for fifteen years, Paris’s endorsement of the Moroccan position has never been as clear or explicit as the newly-announced Spanish stance. Rather, France has long contented itself with rehashing the pro-Morocco language the UN Security Council has been using since 2007. 
France has never said that the Moroccan plan is the most realistic, credible, and serious solution to the Sahara dispute. Instead, born of an apparent desire to sufficiently satisfy Morocco without completely alienating Algeria, the French position is that the Autonomy Plan constitutes “a realistic and credible” proposal. 
We know the well-documented significance of language -- in life as in politics. In political and diplomatic discourse especially, each word carries stupendous weight and the choice of definite or indefinite articles is pregnant with meaning, political significance. To say that the Moroccan Autonomy Plan is “a realistic and credible” proposal is not remotely the same as saying that it is “the most credible, most realistic and serious plan.” 
In the first instance, the speaker leaves the door open to another plan or proposal that may also be “realistic and credible.”  While in the second, which Spain’s Prime Minister used in his letter to King Mohammed VI on March 18, there is no room for any other interpretation. 
For the second speaker, thus, the hailed plan is the only game in town; it is either that plan or nothing. What does that leave us with regarding the issue at hand? This: Whereas Spain used to think like France in applauding Morocco’s plan while leaving the door of credibility and realism open to Algeria’s call for a self-determination referendum, Madrid now believes the Moroccan plan is the only viable route to a lasting solution to the Sahara conflict. 
This shift in the Spanish position -- which I consider a logical development of the Spanish position during the past two decades, given that Spain has moderately supported the Moroccan Autonomy Plan since 2008 -- is widely expected to put European Union countries in front of a dreadful, terrifying truth for many: Morocco’s proposal is the best and only way toward peace, prosperity, and stability in Western Sahara. 
The EU’s time for reckoning
As such, if the EU is serious about sincerely contributing to solving the Sahara conflict, and if it genuinely wishes to strengthen its relations with Morocco on the basis of mutual respect,  it should consider expressing its clear and unequivocal support for the Autonomy Plan. 
Such a strong declaration of support would be the first step in the right direction of furthering essential cooperation between Brussels and Rabat. More than that, however, it would also constitute a vital corroboration of the line of realism and compromise the UN Security resolutions has clearly embraced in all its Sahara conflict-related resolutions since 2007. 
Since 2018 especially, the UN consensus around the Sahara question has been to disqualify an unworkable and impractical self-determination referendum in favor of a realistic, practical, feasible, and compromise-based political solution.  
So, will EU countries follow in Spain's footsteps and recognize the importance of the Sahara for Morocco and Moroccans? And are they willing to stop hiding behind vague and ambiguous declarations to actually, vigorously acknowledge the unanimity that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan has secured in the past decade? 
Judging from the media statement the EU issued yesterday, in which it expressed its satisfaction with the normalization of relations between Morocco and Spain, I think the European bloc is not yet ready to discard its “positive neutrality” posture on the Sahara question to explicitly recognize the unparalleled centrality of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. 
Still, if Algeria’s feverish, ballistic response to Spain’s change of position is any indication, the upcoming months and years will see the Moroccan plan gain much wider currency among diplomats in general and UN negotiators in particular. 
In this sense, Spain’s decision has made crystal clear what the US’ December 10 recognition had symbolically, though meaningfully, pointed to: That for anyone genuinely interested in preserving security, stability, and peace in an already fragile Sahel-Saharan region, Morocco’s plan is the only way forward.

153,Western Sahara: Why Spain Chose to Support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan,"Morocco’s inflexibility in recent diplomatic tensions, the declining importance of Algerian gas, and Moroccan diplomacy’s growing advances all led to Spain’s historic U-turn.",Samir Bennis,"Mar. 24, 2022 2:52 p.m.","Washington DC  - Spain has assumed its historic role on the Sahara question by unequivocally embracing Morocco's Autonomy Plan as the only and best way out of the long-running conflict over the region. And in so doing, Madrid might have also paved the way for other European countries that have been concealing their reluctance to pick Morocco’s side behind vague, ambiguous statements of “positive neutrality.”
To Morocco, meanwhile, the Spanish government’s decision means the era of grandiloquent speeches unsupported by concrete actions is over. Having learned from the recent diplomatic crisis that has considerably damaged its once friendly and strategic relationship with Morocco, Spain appears determined to treat its southern neighbor with due respect, taking into account its interests and concerns.
Morocco: an assertive regional leader
Following the serious diplomatic rift that started between the two neighbors in April of last year, Rabat was adamant that the re-establishment of relations with Madrid could only be done on the basis of a more solid foundation of mutual respect, loyalty, and transparency. 
This Moroccan position was clearly stated in King Mohammed VI's speech commemorating the 46th anniversary of the Green March last November. Despite its willingness to turn the page with Madrid and other Western partners to embark on a new era of sincere and solid friendship, the King said, Morocco would not sign any strategic agreements with countries maintaining ambiguous or ambivalent positions on the Sahara issue. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez showed great courage and wisdom in sending the Moroccan King the letter that announced Spain’s historic adoption of a position that favors the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. 
Unambiguously siding with Morocco was no small feat for the Spanish leader, given that significant sectors of Spain’s public opinion are strongly sympathetic to the Polisario Front’s narrative. And the virulence with which many Spanish commentators have since attacked their country’s support for Morocco’s Sahara stance gives some indication of the audacity it took Sanchez to break with Madrid's historical ambivalence on the Sahara. 
To a certain extent, the wisdom and lucidity of Sanchez's decision should be seen as reflecting his country’s recognition, albeit belated, of the new geopolitical winds prevailing in the Mediterranean region. Morocco's regional influence has prodigiously grown in recent years, with the North African country becoming a regional -- African, to be more precise -- power that now insists on reciprocity and mutual respect in relations with its Western allies. 
This is particularly relevant to Moroccan-Spanish ties. And Sanchez’s letter to King Mohammed VI suggests that Madrid has finally resigned itself to the truth that maintaining good, solid relations with Morocco is key to preserving a large part of its economic and security interests. 
Spain's new, positive stance on Morocco's Autonomy Plan is therefore a clear recognition of Morocco's position as a harbor of stability and prosperity in the Maghreb. It also testifies to both Morocco's growing leadership in the emerging African geopolitical landscape, and -- most importantly -- the growing international consensus in favor of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. 
To be sure, Spain’s new stance does not amount to an explicit recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara. But the novelty is that, for the first time, Madrid recognizes the importance of the Sahara for Morocco, as well as the need to ""guarantee the stability, sovereignty, territory and prosperity of our countries."" As such, without explicitly endorsing the Moroccanness of the Sahara,  Spain has subtly acknowledged Morocco’s sovereignty over the region. 
Volte-face or logical evolution?
While it surely is a historic turning point, the Spanish government's decision to support the Moroccan autonomy initiative does not exactly represent a radical departure from tradition. 
Contrary to trendy suggestions in the Spanish media, Madrid's stance is not a U-turn, but rather a logical evolution of its position in the direction Morocco required and expected from a strategic ally. With Spain bearing considerable historical responsibility in the conflict, the country’s new decision could also be interpreted as a sort of reckoning with history.
Hosting his Moroccan counterpart Abass El Fassi in December 2008, the former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero expressed moderate support for Morocco's Autonomy Plan, praising Rabat’s ""serious and credible"" efforts to resolve the Sahara crisis. The then Spanish PM even added that the Moroccan initiative ""constitutes a positive contribution"" to the solution of the territorial conflict. 
In this, Zapatero's speech simply echoed the language used in UN Security Council resolutions since 2007, when Morocco presented its Autonomy Plan. Yet, although this Spanish position was not a clear endorsement of the Moroccan plan, it was welcomed in Rabat amidst a regional and international context that was back then far from being supportive of the Moroccan thesis. 
Spain maintained a position of “positive neutrality” even during the two terms of former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (2011-18). But things started going awry for Spain in 2018, with Pedro Sanchez coming to power in 2018 in a geopolitical context that was increasingly favorable to Morocco. 
Key in Spain’s decision to change some of its historical positions vis-a-vis Morocco was the sight of: Morocco reclaiming its leadership in Africa, becoming a key player in the Mediterranean region, and securing unprecedented international consensus around its Autonomy Plan. Madrid had to either embark on the new geopolitical boat of a boldly assertive Morocco or ignore reality and be swept away by overwhelmingly pro-Morocco diplomatic winds. 
However, at the moment of truth, when Morocco's position received a significant impetus with the American recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara, Spain failed to answer the call of history and chose instead to settle some scores with Morocco. 
The Spanish government broke its positive neutrality commitment with declarations that smacked of some sort of fundamental hostility to Morocco’s Western Sahara stance. A striking illustration of this was the then Spanish foreign minister’s tirade against the US recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over the Sahara. 
Faced with such dismissiveness from Spain, Morocco decided to postpone indefinitely the high-level Moroccan-Spanish meeting that was scheduled to be held in Rabat in December 2020. And things got out of hand between April and May 2021 after news emerged of Spain hosting the Polisario leader under a false identity. 
While many in Rabat had long expressed their dissatisfaction with Spain's duplicity on a number of highly sensitive and important issues for Morocco, Madrid’s decision to shelter Ghali and then shrug off Morocco’s complaints was a step too far.  
For Morocco, it was clear that Sanchez's government had broken a tacit agreement Rabat and Madrid signed in 2004.  Under that agreement, Morocco was to shelve its territorial claims over Ceuta and Melilla and instead strengthen cooperation with Spain in the fight against illegal immigration. In return, Madrid agreed to commit to a position of positive neutrality on the Sahara issue. 
Since then, although Spain’s official statements did not appear to support Morocco’s Sahara position, Spanish diplomats continued to endorse the Moroccan Autonomy Plan behind the scenes. 
In hindsight, it now seems this Ghali-linked 18 months-long diplomatic crisis was a necessary evil. Spain's newfound, unequivocal endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan is a step that Morocco had long been waiting -- and hoping -- for. 
In exchange for Spain’s new position, Morocco is likely to commit to alleviating the severe economic crisis that the two enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla have been witnessing since Rabat decided to close their borders more than two years ago. 
That does not mean, of course, that Morocco will agree to open up to the smuggling spout from the two enclaves. Rather, in their new agreement, Morocco and Spain will be considering alternative solutions that can serve their respective interests, without Morocco questioning Spain’s legitimacy claims over the two enclaves. 
For official on both sides, the important thing remains that restoring bilateral relations benefit the fight against illegal immigration and the delimitation of the maritime space of both countries off the Atlantic.
Spain’s concession 
Four main reasons stand behind Spain's positive shift on Morocco's Autonomy Plan. Throughout the recent diplomatic crisis, Morocco’s firm resolution succeeded in showing Spain that its territorial integrity is non-negotiable. 
Intractable and inflexible on the fundamentals of its Sahara position, Morocco signaled that it was ready to prolong the diplomatic crisis for as long as necessary until Spain was willing to treat Morocco as an equal partner. 
Enraged by Spain's ""betrayal"" and irreverent lack of reciprocity during the Brahim Ghali episode, Rabat made it clear that there could be no alliance or friendship with Spain so long as Spain continued to: violate the July 1990 cooperation and neighborliness treaty; shirk its historical responsibility in the Sahara conflict; and decline to recognize the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the only viable solution to the Sahara question.
With its back to the wall after months of crisis, Spain started winking at Morocco in an effort to get it to soften its stance. One telling moment of Spain’s growing readiness to defuse tensions was Pedro Sanchez’s reshuffling of his cabinet by notably removing the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Arancha Sanchez Laya. 
And with the appointment of Jose Manuel Albarez as the chief of Spanish diplomacy, Madrid’s discourse on Morocco shifted drastically. Visibly keen to organize a meeting with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita, Albarez spoke repeatedly in favorable, laudatory terms of Spain’s “essential” and “indispensable” cooperation with Morocco. 
But Rabat ignored Madrid’s charm offensive,  suggesting there would be no restoration of “strategic alliance” or “traditional partnership” as long as Spain was not prepared to end its “duplicity” and support Morocco's territorial integrity. 
The second factor in Spain's U-turn is the recent change in Germany's position on the Sahara. Germany's decision to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan caught the Spanish government off guard, especially since Berlin had long been at the forefront of European countries that opposed any agreements between the EU and Morocco that included the Sahara. 
In their coverage of Germany’s decision, several Spanish media outlets said the move showed the Spanish government that if it wanted to re-establish relations with Morocco on a solid basis, it should simply follow the Germans' lead. 
The third factor -- and perhaps the most important -- is Algerian gas. Gas is the cornerstone of the relationship between Spain and Algeria. It was central to the agreements that the Spanish government and its Algerian counterpart brokered between 1972 and 1975 to prevent Morocco from recovering the Sahara. 
In the wake of the July 1972 tripartite summit in Agadir, through which the late King Hassan II sought to establish a common position with Algeria and Mauritania in order to force Spain to cede the Sahara back to Morocco, the then head of Spanish diplomacy, Lopez Bravo, rushed to visit Algiers and Nouakchott to thwart Morocco's strategy.
Bravo and his Algerian counterpart, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, notably signed a trade agreement worth $500 million during the Spanish minister’s visit to Algiers -- under which Spain committed to buying Algerian gas. Algeria has since employed gas to pressure Madrid into taking a position of equidistance between Rabat and Algiers. 
The Algerian game has grown in scale and effectiveness over the years, especially since Algeria has been the leading supplier of natural gas to the Spanish economy for five decades. Until last year, 45 % of Spain's gas needs came from Algeria, a large part of which was supplied through the Europe-Maghreb gas pipeline, whose contract Algeria recently decided to terminate.
That decision to not renew the agreement on the gas pipeline linking Algeria, Spain, and Portugal via Morocco has turned all strategic calculations upside down. Although intended to hurt or “punish” Morocco’s gas market, the Algerian decision has proved to be a geopolitical boon for Rabat. 
Notably, the decision has caused serious damage to the Spanish economy, sending shock waves through the Spanish political establishment. For many in Madrid, the main takeaway has been that Algeria is not a country on which Spain should rely to meet its energy needs. 
Spain has therefore turned to other markets to replace Algerian gas. In particular, the US market has become, for the first time since last February, the primary source of supply for the Spanish market. The US now accounts for 39% of Spain’s gas imports, far ahead of Algeria’s 23% since the closure of the Maghreb pipeline. 
With the Algerian gas set to decline in importance for the Spanish economy, Spain will eventually free itself from Algerian pressure and will be able to manage its relations with Morocco without the usual, Algeria-linked political calculation. That is the reason Madrid decided to endorse Morocco's Autonomy Plan. 
But many in the Spanish have appeared to fear that Algiers would retaliate against Madrid and cut off gas supplies. These reports missed one critical point, however: Gas contracts are long-term deals and no state can unilaterally break them. 
Whatever Algeria chooses to do next following its furious response to Spain’s endorsement of Morocco’s autonomy proposal, the country will have no choice but to honor its gas contract with Spain until 2030. Again, the inter-state regulations governing the gas business are not the same as those of the oil trade. 
Had an oil deal been the primary driver of Spain-Algeria relations, then yes, Algeria would have had the option of suspending its supplies to Spain, since oil contracts are generally short-term. This is an extremely important fact that must be taken into account when analyzing the reasons that led the Sanchez government to position itself in favor of Morocco, regardless of Algeria’s protestations. 
Indeed, Sanchez knows that Algeria, which also needs money, will not be able to terminate the gas contract binding it to Spain. And should Algeria decide to somehow terminate the contract, it would be in blatant violation of the international law that governs such deals. Most significantly, such a move would expose Algiers to the wrath of both Europe and the United States, especially in an international context marked by the war in Ukraine. 
Why would the USA care that much about a gas deal between Algiers and Madrid? An American company, Blackrock, shares 49% of the Medgaz pipeline with Naturgy, Spain’s national gas company; the remaining 51% of the Medgaz deal is held by Algeria’s Sonatrach. 
In addition to these three factors, the war in Ukraine and the geopolitical, political and security upheavals that it is likely to bring about in the short, medium and long terms have also played a role in Spain's shifting of its Western Sahara position in favor of Morocco's autonomy initiative. 
With Europe watching the situation in Ukraine with apprehension, many in Spain fear that a prolongation of the  Russia-Ukraine conflict will lead to unprecedented refugee flows and put the country in an overwhelming migration crisis. 
As it expects a substantial number of refugees fleeing Ukraine, Spain needs to secure its southern border by ensuring the cooperation of its southern neighbor, Morocco. Madrid’s goal and hope, then, is to get Rabat to help stem the flow of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, which has been devastated by the effects of the COVID crisis, notably food insecurity and political instability. 
What about France?
On a broader geostrategic front, Spain's clear support for Morocco's Autonomy Plan is sure to pile up pressure on France. It is true that since Morocco presented its Autonomy Plan to the Security Council in 2007, France has been at the forefront of the countries that have supported it. 
Yet this support has never gone beyond an almost mechanical repetition of the language used in the UN Security Council resolutions -- applauding Morocco's plan and describing it as a ""serious and credible"" basis for resolving the Sahara conflict. 
Even with the US recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over the Sahara having consecrated Morocco’s thesis and made a pro-Morocco shift less risky, France has continued to embrace the Moroccan plan as only ""a serious and credible basis"" to solve the Sahara conflict. But, as I said in a previous analysis, there is, especially in diplomatic language, an abysmal semantic and political difference between the use of a definite and indefinite article. 
In saying that the autonomy plan is “the most serious, credible and realistic” option, Spain is ruling out any other options. This contrasts starkly with France's language, which continues to leave the room open to other alternativer or interpretations. 
Like Spain -- and more than any other Western or European country -- France bears a major responsibility in the origins of the Sahara conflict. Spain would never have occupied the Sahara in the first place without both the Franco-British agreement of April 1904 and the secret agreement that Paris signed with Madrid in October of the same year. 
If Spain had not received military assistance from France and its campaign of ""pacification of Morocco"" (which was in fact a campaign of terror against Moroccan resistance forces) until 1934, it would never have been able to effectively occupy the territory in southern Morocco. 
Faced with the latest developments in the Sahara issue -- the UN and African consensus on the need for compromise and realism, the  US recognition of the Moroccanness of the Sahara, and now the German and Spanish declarations in favor of the Moroccan position -- it is now up to France to make the choice that is so obviously necessary. 
Such a decision will serve not only to repair one of the most cruel injustices that Western colonial conquest has inflicted on Morocco, but it will also and above demonstrate to Morocco and the Moroccan people the sincerity of the French position on the Sahara. 
Moroccan diplomacy, meanwhile, should make sure to implement the central thesis of King Mohammed VI's speech during the 46th anniversary of the Green March: That Morocco will sign no strategic partnership deals with countries that maintain ambiguous or ambivalent, or even subtly hostile positions on Morocco's Western Sahara stance.

154,Western Sahara: Algeria Handed Morocco Spain’s Support on a Silver Platter,"With its blind hatred of Morocco and absence of strategic vision, Algeria handed Spain to Morocco on a silver platter.",Samir Bennis,"Mar. 22, 2022 6:24 p.m.","Washington D.C - With the benefit of hindsight,  it’s now clear that Algeria’s halting of the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline contract, the natural gas pipeline that linked it to Spain and Portugal via  Morocco, was a strategic blunder.
 As it sought to gas-starve Morocco, the Algerian regime ended up fatally murdering all its ambitions to prevent Rabat from making a major breakthrough in its decades-long efforts to get Spain to support its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
 In this sense, Algeria’s cancellation of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline was an unprecedented and valuable gift to Morocco. For one thing, the move has reduced Spain's dependence on Algerian natural gas, given that the gas passing through Morocco accounted for 23 percent of the gas imported from Algeria by Madrid.
The decision has also shown Spanish officials that Algeria is no longer a trustworthy and reliable country in terms of meeting the Spanish market gas needs.
Algeria’s miscalculated gamble
 Algeria’s natural gas accounted for 60 percent of Spain's consumption at the turn of the century and ranged between 50 and 60 percent between 2014 and 2018. 
But due to the short-sightedness of Algeria's generals, Spain's imports of Algerian gas nosedived in recent months, falling from 45 percent in previous months to 23 percent last month. The US supplied 34.6 percent of Spain’s gas needs between January and February this year, supplanting Algeria as the European country’s first gas supplier. 
In September of last year, the US share in Spain’s gas imports was as low as 16 percent. With the surge of US LNG exports to Spain in recent months, it has compensated for the more than 23 percent of Spain’s gas imports through the now-closed Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline.  
 The agility with which Spain has adapted to the considerable decrease in Algerian gas exports to the Spanish market further implies that Madrid has been proactively dealing with this issue for several years now. Spain has pulled through thanks to its world-class liquefied natural gas infrastructure and its long-standing strategy to increase liquefied gas in its import share.
Over the years, Spain has built state-of-the-art infrastructure for the storage and conversion of liquefied gas. Spain is currently the most advanced European country in terms of infrastructure in natural gas storage, boasting six LNG terminals, while a country like Germany has none. Spain alone hosts the third of Europe’s LNG storage capacity.
Such a proactive approach and foresight was instrumental in helping Madrid overcome the devastating effects that the Algerian regime’s reckless decision to terminate the Europe-Maghreb pipeline would have had on the Spanish economy.
Algiers’s decision to stop the gas pipeline was intended to punish and harm Morocco's economy. But little did the Algerian regime suspect that this miscalculated gamble could harm its own strategic interests, especially its relationship with Spain. As of this year, LNG has supplanted natural gas in Spain’s gas market, representing 70 percent of its total imports. Just a year ago, LNG represented less than 50 percent of Spain’s gas imports.

Given its advanced infrastructure in terms of natural gas storage, Madrid will gradually be able to reduce Algeria's impact on its economy and weaken the gas card that the Algerian regime has been playing for five decades to pressure Spain and dissuade it from supporting the Moroccanness of Western Sahara.
Algeria was painfully reminded of this sober reality when, on Friday last week, Spain announced a historic shift regarding its position on Western Sahara.
In affirming, for the first time, its clear and straightforward support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, Madrid put an end to the sitting-on-the-fence or equidistance policy with which it had approached the Sahara question for much of the past five decades to preserve its interests.
But more than the shattering of Madrid’s long-standing equidistance policy, Spain’s newfound support for Morocco’s Western Sahara stance means Algeria has lost the gas leverage it used to have on the Spanish political elite. The timing of Wendy Sherman, US Deputy Secretary of State to Spain, Morocco, and Algeria earlier this month, and just less than weeks before Spain announced its endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan suggest that there was coordination between Rabat, Madrid, and Washington. 
As some reports have indicated, this curious coincidence suggests that Spain may have received guarantees from the US administration that it will intensify its gas supplies to the Spanish economy and eventually help the European country wean itself off Algeria’s gas. 
Spain knows that apart from the gas deal its partnership with Algeria is almost non-existent. Furthermore, Spain is fully aware that the bilateral trade balance has always been in Algeria's favor.
By comparison, the European country has dense and multiple interests in and with Morocco, be it in terms of economic and commercial cooperation or the security and shared destiny by virtue of geographical proximity.
On the economic front, for instance, more than 1,000 Spanish companies are currently operating in Morocco. As well, Spain has become Morocco's first economic partner with a favorable trade surplus that impacts its economy positively. 
Algeria cannot retaliate
Contrary to what is being claimed in some Spanish media and political circles, Algeria will not be able to take any punitive decision against Spain.
And anyone who thinks Algeria can still halt gas flowing to Spain has, to put it rather politely, a wrong and misguided reading of the situation. Unlike oil-related contracts that are often short-term deals, gas contracts are long-term agreements that extend for multiple years if not decades.
Hence, Algeria is bound to honor the deal it signed with Spain in 2018 on the Medgaz pipeline connecting the Algerian city of Beni Saf to the Spanish city of Almeria. The agreement is valid until 2030, meaning Algeria will not -- or cannot, more precisely -- halt its gas exports to Spain.
Even more critical, Algeria will not be able to review the deal’s financial terms and mold them with the current rise in gas prices.
But should the Algerian regime somehow muster the temerity of terminating its gas deal with Spain in retaliation for the country’s pro-Moroccan stance on Western Sahara, it would be in blatant violation of the regulations that govern such contracts between states.
In such a highly unlikely scenario, Algiers would also be under pressure from the European Union and the United States, which has been working painstakingly for months to reduce the EU's dependence on Russian gas.
The Medgaz pipeline is 51 % owned by Algeria's Sonatrach, while the Spanish company Naturgy and the American company Blackrock share the remaining 49 %. Thus, if Algeria takes any retaliatory step against Spain, it would put itself in direct confrontation with the US.
In short, with its regime’s lack of strategic vision coupled with the blind hatred of Morocco, Algeria handed Spain to Morocco on a silver platter. In seeking to “punish” Rabat, Algiers ended up unwittingly fulfilling Morocco’s long-running goal of securing Madrid’s unequivocal embrace of the Moroccan position on Western Sahara.
More important than US’ recognition
Spain's declaration of support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is psychologically and symbolically more meaningful than the United States’ recognition of the Moroccanness of Western Sahara, which has become US official policy. 
With Spain having substantial political and cultural influence in Latin American countries, its newly-adopted position on the Sahara will undoubtedly affect that of many other countries in Latin America. So, the Spanish move might prove to be additional good news for Morocco given the country's recent investments in buttressing its diplomatic outreach in Latin America.
 But an even more pertinent reason is Spain’s historical association with, and responsibility in, the Western Sahara dispute. As the former colonial power of Morocco’s southern provinces, Spain’s epochal change of its long-held position of “positive neutrality” on the dispute is undoubtedly more shocking to, and unbearable for, the Algerian regime than the US’ endorsement of Morocco.
Since the end of 1960s, Madrid and Algeria have stood against Morocco’s territorial integrity and regularly colluded to thwart the country’s efforts to reunite with its southern provinces.
As such, Algeria’s furious response to Spain’s endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan speaks of the unparalleled pain and agony of losing leverage over, and the support of, a long-time accomplice.
For Morocco, meanwhile, Madrid’s historic change of heart is a potent vindication of the increasing preeminence of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the best way out of the decades-long diplomatic gridlock in Western Sahara. 
 And so, that Morocco was eventually able to dismantle the Algiers-Madrid pact, which had long worked in secret to oppose Morocco’s interests, is a testament to the growing effectiveness of Moroccan diplomacy.

155,Western Sahara: The Significance of 2022 US Consolidated Appropriations Bill for Morocco,The 2022 US Appropriations Bill has created a momentous precedent for the long-running pro-Morocco momentum on the Sahara question.,Samir Bennis,"Mar. 18, 2022 4:11 p.m.","Washington - For pro-Polisario commentators and lobbyists still hoping that the Biden administration will at some point repudiate the US’ pro-Morocco policy on the Western Sahara dispute, the US Consolidated Appropriations Bill signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 15 is the latest indication that the recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara is now official US policy.  
Ever since President Joe Biden came to office, Algerian-paid Lobbyists and many pro-Polisario pundits have been hoping to see the new administration reverse its predecessor’s recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. In fact, many of the most vociferous pro-Polisario voices in the US were quick to dismiss former President Donald Trump’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. 
As they saw it, Trump’s siding with Morocco in its decade-long diplomatic fight against Algerian-backed separatism was at best a unilateral and pointless move, and at worst a reckless and unconscionable violation of international law and traditional US foreign policy.
Driven by the self-righteous fury that has become the marker of pro-Polisario advocacy, some of them called on the Biden administration to disavow the December 10 proclamation to restore what they described as US neutrality. In their truncated and self-serving telling of the Western Sahara story -- and history -- they brazenly argued that the now disqualified referendum of self-determination remains the general international consensus on how to end the Sahara conflict.  
By shrewdly and misleadingly invoking separatist talking points like “self-determination,” “oppression,” and “occupation,” they hoped to galvanize the new American administration into embracing what they presented as the US’ commitment to the downtrodden and wretched of the world. As anyone familiar with Polisario’s shock strategy would know, this was victimology at its best.
Judging from Biden’s lukewarm but non-insignificant embrace of his predecessor’s Western Sahara policy, and the US Congress’ increasingly clear support for Morocco, however, it is safe to say that the past two years have been a clear dismissal of Algerian-paid lobbyists’ pro-Polisario propaganda.      
Language Matters
To be sure, the Biden administration’s Western Sahara juggling act is not exactly the ringing support that many in Rabat expected. Yet, the Appropriations Bill has provided further cogent evidence that calculated hesitation and temporary diplomatic sensitivity should not be confused with utter repudiation or unmistakable rejection.
For one thing, the document has shown that, rather than the product of a whimsical president, the US’ embrace of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the best way out of the Sahara conflict was the culmination of decades-long US support for Morocco’s efforts to preserve its territorial integrity. 
To put things into perspective: The “Morocco” subheading of the new bill reads that “Funds appropriated under titles III and IV of this Act shall be made available for assistance for Morocco.” It is thus the first US bill to refer to Morocco without any mention of “Western Sahara.” And because language carries an important weight in political documents, the main takeaway from the “Morocco” section of this new US spending bill is that the US administration now views “Western Sahara” as unambiguously Moroccan.
In all previous US bills relating to US assistance to Morocco, US lawmakers made sure to systematically imply that because the final status of Western Sahara was still “pending,” it was not to be considered under Morocco’s sovereignty.
And so, even as most US appropriations put no major hurdles in Morocco’s way to use the funds allocated to it in Western Sahara, there was always a thin nuance by means of which US lawmakers sought to ensure that the allocation of these funds to Western Sahara was not tantamount to explicitly recognizing Morocco’s full sovereignty over the territory. 
For example, all US Appropriation Bills adopted between 2014 and 2021 made funds allocated to Morocco available for use in Western Sahara. But the use of these funds was subject to certain restrictions and was contingent on the Department of State notifying congress within three months of the appropriation bill and after consulting with the Appropriations Committee on the use of such funds in Western Sahara. 
For all Congress’ nuance and caution when it came to endorsing the use of those funds in “Western Sahara,” Morocco viewed US lawmakers’ guarded permission as tacit support for its sovereignty over the region. 
Algeria’S Short-Lived Victories
But slightly complicating the story for Morocco is that Algeria was keen to take advantage of Congress’ hesitations. The country recruited a lobbying firm, Foley Hoag, to lobby certain influential members of Congress to sabotage Morocco's efforts to resolve the dispute. The Senate was Algerian lobbyist’s most preferred turf for much of the past two decades. Foley Hoag relied on the sympathy of two extremely influential senators -- James Inhofe and Patrick Leahy -- to relay Algeria’s concerns to the other members of the Senate, they short-lived. 
In 2018, for example, Inhofe and Leahy succeeded in persuading the Senate to adopt an appropriations bill that decoupled Morocco from Western Sahara. This version of the bill did not, however, make it to the final version adopted in the House. As a result, the consolidated bill adopted by both chambers of Congress -- and later on signed into law by the Trump administration -- included Morocco and its Western Sahara region under the same subheading. 
Long before the 2022 Appropriation Bill’s decidedly pro-Morocco language, the Biden’s administration had given many signs of its commitment to Morocco’s Western Sahara position. 
Morocco’S Momentum
The most important such signals were the adoption by the US State Department and other US government-affiliated institutions of undivided maps of Morocco, and the inclusion of Western Sahara in the “Morocco” section of the State Department’s latest country report on Human right and religious freedoms. As such, the past months have made it increasingly clear that Algeria and its lobbyist’s pro-Polisario propaganda will continue to fall on deaf ears given the US’ commitment to upholding its Western Sahara policy.      
The deafening silence of Algerian media following President Biden’s signing of the 2022 Appropriations Bill this week speaks volumes. Frustrated and dismayed, Algeria is now realizing that the novelty of the new bill in comparison to the previous ones is that it contains absolutely no ambiguity as to US support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. 
The fact that the US bill completely omits the term “Western Sahara” and refers instead to Morocco as a single, indivisible territory is a huge diplomatic setback for Algeria and signals the dwindling credibility and effectiveness of its lobbying efforts in Washington. By underlining US support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the only legitimate basis of any solution to the decades-long conflict, the text of the 2022 Appropriation Bill shows the progress Morocco has made over the past 15 years to secure support for its territorial integrity despite Algerian attempts to undermine its efforts in Washington.           
The 2008 Appropriation bill did not, for instance, make funds allocated to Morocco available for use in Western Sahara. Rather, it provided $3.65 million of military assistance to Morocco, and made an additional $1 million available for use in Western Sahara.
Most importantly, the use of the funds allocated to “Western Sahara” was contingent on Morocco making “progress on human rights.” If the Moroccan wished to use US funds in Western Sahara, the bill stressed, it had to allow “all persons to advocate freely their views regarding the status and future of the Western Sahara through the exercise of their rights to peaceful expression, association and assembly.” 
Four years later, the 2012 Appropriations bill placed the same restrictions on the use of funds allocated to Morocco. As well as making a distinction between Morocco and Western Sahara, the bill involved the same “human rights progress” conditions as in 2008. By contrast, the 2022 Appropriations Bill has created a momentous precedent for the long-running pro-Morocco momentum on the Sahara question.
By omitting the term “Western Sahara” and referring to Morocco as a single nation, the 2022 US Appropriations Bill signals a new era in US foreign policy and provides Congress with the legal clarity it needs to act confidently and decisively in support of Moroccan territorial integrity, however hard Algeria tries to lobby against it.
But because the Algerian establishment sees Western Sahara as the epitome of its zero-sum competition against Morocco for hegemony over the Maghreb, the latest, pro-Moroccan developments are sure to push Algeria to redouble its lobbying efforts to undo the diplomatic progress Morocco has achieved in Washington in recent years.      
However, given the current pro-Rabat sentiment in Washington, and the announced retirement of Senators Leahy and Inhofe, anyone betting on Algeria’s ability to sway the Washington political establishment in its favor on the Sahara question will be betting on a losing horse. 
And yet, as I have argued elsewhere, however, this new era of unprecedented pro-Morocco momentum should not be an excuse for Moroccan officials to grow complacent and rest on their laurels.

156,Innovation Can Cement Israel and Morocco’s Budding Relationship,"As we transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one, the answer to all these challenges lies in innovation and in our ability to identify opportunities to work together to overcome them. That kind of cooperation cannot be built overnig",Avi Hasson,"May 23, 2022 9:32 a.m.","Though Israel and Morocco share many historical and cultural ties, geopolitical issues have long kept our two nations separate. That changed at the end of 2020 when the two countries began establishing full diplomatic and trade relations.
Since then, embassies have been opened, dozens of G2G MOUs have been signed and direct flights have begun flying on a near-daily basis. What’s still lagging, however, are the business-to-business and people-to-people ties, the kind that will really cement the relationship and transform it from a formal normalization agreement into a genuine warm peace that can benefit all Moroccans and Israelis.
As a 30-year veteran of the Israeli tech industry, having filled a range of roles in both the private and public sectors, I am convinced that innovation is the key to expediting and enhancing our relationship and ensuring mutually beneficial outcomes.
Israel and Morocco may be different in many ways, but what both our countries share is a passion for progress and a belief that advanced technology must be an economic anchor. For Israel, it already is, with technology accounting for more than 50% of its exports, and for Morocco, it is very much a goal — a cornerstone of King Mohammed VI’s New Development Model, which charts the country’s economic path for 2035.
In my experience, the best innovation is a result of finding creative new solutions to significant challenges. The story of the Israeli innovation ecosystem as a whole is one of necessity forcing people to come up with innovative ways to overcome deficiencies or obstacles, whether that is drip irrigation to solve water shortages or the firewall to cope with malicious cyberattacks. For better or worse, Israel and Morocco share many of the same challenges.
Both our countries must cope with a climate that is often hostile to agriculture and food security, we have both been negatively impacted by logistical and supply chain-related concerns, we both seek to secure our future energy needs through transitioning to more sustainable sources, and we both have young and growing populations who we want to ensure can secure employment opportunities in rewarding fields.
As we transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one, the answer to all these challenges lies in innovation and in our ability to identify opportunities to work together to overcome them. That kind of cooperation cannot be built overnight and from behind the desks of government officials, no matter how committed and well-meaning they are. Collaboration of the type I am advocating for needs to be built over time, by trusted partners who identify each other's motivations, capabilities, and pain points, and then seek ways to turn them into real-world solutions.
Fortunately, the similarities I mentioned between Israel and Morocco do not put us on a collision course. Both the geographic distance and the differences between our two economies mean that instead of competing with each other, our countries can complement each other. Nowhere is this potential more apparent than when it comes to human capital.
While Israel has long suffered from a chronic shortage of high-quality personnel for its booming tech industry, Morocco suffers from the opposite problem, a shortage of jobs to meet the needs of its talented college graduates, who often have to seek employment opportunities abroad.  There is every reason to believe that by joining forces and connecting our two tech sectors, we can come up with ways to mitigate each other’s challenges. Similar solutions can be found in the areas of capital investments, research and development, and market access, with each country benefitting from the advantages of the other.
Having worked closely with entrepreneurs for many years, I know that they require two seemingly contradictory forces in order to flourish. On one hand, they need consistency so they build long-term plans and see them out to fruition, and on the other, they need a level of dynamism that can react to the ever-shifting nature of the economy. While the King’s New Development Model provides the former, I believe that infusing it with the characteristically Israeli attributes of agility and risk-taking can provide a formidable boost.
For Israel, Morocco is in many ways a hidden gem, less obvious than our other Abraham Accord partners in terms of market size and opportunity, which means there is more of a chance to make an impact. Israeli technologies introduced to the North African hub can rapidly find their way to the entire continent, opening the door to an often overlooked and undervalued consumer base.
By building a bridge between Israel and Morocco with innovation ties at its foundation, I hope we can also inspire other countries, namely Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria to put aside past differences and recognize the value of working in partnership with the Start-Up Nation.

157,The Almoravid Heritage and Modern Day Moroccan Geostrategy,"The use of history as a means impugn motives with regard to modern legitimate political objectives, namely liberation from Spanish colonialism, seems to be a strangely desperate attempt to swap roles so that the one who seeks liberation becomes the one wi",Lahcen Haddad,"May 17, 2022 1:24 p.m.","Those who interpret Morocco’s geostrategic goals as only the tip of the iceberg of a much larger and hidden political agenda to rebuild the Middle Ages’ Grand Maghrib (The Greater Morocco), which saw its peak during the Almoravids and the Almohads, are merely engaged in a politically calculated process of impugning of motives. The objective is clearly political: to stand in Morocco’s way of legitimizing its liberation of Western Sahara from Spanish Colonialism and its efforts to get back the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla from Spain, as well as thwarting its effort to demarcate its maritime borders in accordance with the provisions of international maritime law. 
The use of history as a means impugn motives with regard to modern legitimate political objectives, namely liberation from Spanish colonialism, seems to be a strangely desperate attempt to swap roles so that the one who seeks liberation becomes the one with undisclosed colonial intentions.   
Yet, that is a blessing in disguise. The proponents of the “expansionist theory” who accuse Morocco of having proto-colonial interests underscore, ironically enough, the North African country’s historically legitimate claim for Western Sahara, because, they, unwillingly, recognize it as having been part and parcel of Moroccan rule and sovereignty since the twelfth century (i.e. approximately ten centuries ago)—as were by the way, Western Algeria, Mauritania, and Al-Andalus.  
Does this mean that Morocco has the right to claim Algeria, Mauritania and Al-Andalus? Of course not. This is not a viable option as these countries, whose sovereignty is internationally recognized, are now independent. Algeria was a province that was for sure under the rule of the Moroccan dynasties of the Almoravids (11th & 12th C.), the Almohads (12th and 13th C.), the Marinids (13th  & 15th C. ), the Wattasids (15th & 16th C.), and of the Ottoman empire for 3 centuries, from 1516 till 1838. It was a French colony for 132 years, from 1830 till 1962 and became an independent and full-fledged country since 1962. Mauritania gained independence in 1960, and Andalusia is a region of Spain since the fall of Granada in 1492. 
As for the Western Sahara, which was liberated by Morocco from the Spanish colonizer in 1975, it has been registered by the North African country on the UN List of Non Self-Governing Territories in 1964. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a resolution on October 16, 1975, stating that, contrary to what Franco was claiming, Western Sahara, was not a terra nullus, and stressing that allegiance bonds linking the Sahrawi populations to the Moroccan kings existed over the centuries. After the signature of the Madrid Accords in 1975 by virtue of which Western Sahara was liberated from Spanish Colonialism and returned to its legitimate people, i.e. the Moroccans, the territory should have been removed from the list of Non self-Governing Territories but, unfortunately, it was not. 
Let us dive into history to see how far this relationship goes. Let us follow the traces of history, zooming in on the Almoravid dynasty to see how the events that took place between 1040-1147 shaped, in an indelible and irreversible manner, how Western Sahara has always already been Moroccan since the Almoravid time. 
The Almoravids first emerged as a reform movement that relied on the unity of the Amazigh Sanhaja tribes, whose territories spread from the Senegal River in the south, passing through the areas of M’Sila, Tri, and Mellah in Algeria, and then to the Atlas and the Rif mountains in Morocco. Afterwards, growing stronger militarily, the movement took control of commercial roads, becoming an Islamic state that stretches from present-day Mauritania, western Algeria, and Morocco, all the way to Al-Andalus and up until the borders of Castile and the Kingdom of Navarre.
In the first quarter of the eleventh century, Yahya ben Ibrahim, leader of the Amazigh Sanhaja confederation –comprised of the Lamtuna (ancestors of the present Sahara inhabitants), Kadala, Gzula and Mesmuda tribes, among others – asked Abdullah Ben Yassin, a student of Waggag Ben Zallu al-Lamti who was stationed in the coastal town of Aglou west of Tiznit, to accompany him to the Sahara and parts of Western Sudan (present-day  Mali and Mauritania, all the way up to Adrar, Twat, Es-Sakia el Hamra and Oued Eddahab,) in order to spread Islam in these areas.
After initial failures, Abdullah Ben Yassin was able to build a strong Ribat (a monastery-like center for the devout, the pious and the pilgrim) on the Senegal River, implementing Sharia laws, including hudud (corporal punishments for fornication, adultery, alcohol drinking, theft and robbery etc.), thereby severely punishing those he thought were astray from his strict understanding of religion. On the other hand, he united the tribes of Lamtuna, Kadala, Masoufa and others, based on a tight organization of faith and on the fundamentals of the Da’wah (Islamic preaching). The jihad initiated by Ben Yassin first led him to the Kingdom of Ghana, where he recaptured Audaghost (present-day eastern Mauritania) and parts of the Niger River. 
Despite the death of Yahya Ben Ibrahim and later Yahya Ben Omar, the Almoravids gained wide acclaim. Hence, under the religious and military command of Ben Yassin, the newly-emerged power in Africa annexed a huge chunk of western Sudan, and expanded from the Senegal River to the south and the Niger River to the east all the way to the south of Oued Noun, passing through Tiris Zemmour, Adrar, Es-Sakia el Hamra, Oued Ed-Dahab, and further north. 
Perhaps the leading event that established Almoravids' control of Maghrib al-Aqsa (present-day Morocco) was the conquest of the Souss region in 445 A.H -1054 AD when Waggag Ben Zallu al-Lamti asked Ben Yassin to help Souss inhabitants put an end to the control of the Zenati Maghrawis. Consequently, a battle took place, ending with Sijilmassa’s fall in the hands of the Almoravids, after which it was “cleansed” of all manifestations of “al-Munkar” (evil deeds), in the light of Ben Yassin’s fundamentalist interpretation of religion.
After controlling Sijilmassa’s uprising against Almoravids' religious intolerance as well as subduing Kadala tribe’s rebellion against the Lamtuna tribesmen’s domination and monopoly of key positions in government, the military commander Abu Bakr bin Omar (who succeeded his brother Yahya) moved to the Souss region in 448 A.H-1056 AD. It was at this period that the military commander Yusuf bin Tashfeen emerged as a potential leader of the Islamic state. He was appointed by Abdullah bin Yassin governor of Sijilmassa. Starting from there, he expanded his territory to include Taroudant, Massa, and Kadala. After capturing the Souss region, the Almoravids headed to Aghmat, where they killed its prince –Lqout Maghraoui– and took over the important city. 
Enjoying one victory after the other, the Almoravids army went to battle against the allegedly heretic Barghwata (who had written their own version of the Qur’an) near Rabat. It was in one of these ferocious battles that the Almoravids lost their great leader Abdullah Ben Yassin in 1059. After receiving allegiance to succeed Ben Yassin as both religious leader and military commander, Abu Bakr took control of Zenata, Miknasa, and Louata, before returning to Aghmat.
Overpopulation in the town of Aghmat prompted the establishment of a new capital, Marrakech. The new city was chosen to be as close as possible to the original tribes of Lamtuna, Kadala and Jazoula (some of which are the ancestors of the present-day Western Sahara tribes, namely the Tekna, Errguibet, Ouled Dlim, Laaroussiyin, Zarguiyyin etc.) and not far from the strongholds of the dissident Maghrawa and Barghawata. 
Abu Baker then led half his army to Lamtuna and Kadala to solve the arousing disputes that were breaking out between the two Sahrawi tribes, while leaving the other half under the command of his cousin Yussef who was supposed to set off from Marrakech as well to quell the revolutions of the rebellious tribes of Zenata and Maghrawa to the north. It was the same army led by Yussef that would later on capture the north and east of Maghrib al-Aqsa, as well as all of Maghrib al-Awsat (present-day Algeria minus the southern Saharan parts ) before conquering Al-Andalus.
The Sahrawi depth of the Moroccan state remained relatively strong during the reign of the Almohads (1121-1269). Yet, the peak of the close attachment between the Moroccan state and the Sahrawi tribes was in the Saadi era (1510-1659), when the dynasty controlled the long strip of land stretching southwards from Twat and Taghaza to Timbuktu, Gao, and Tjini. 
This close connection was further solidified with the Alawi dynasty (beginning in 1666) whose armies penetrated as far as Chenguiti all the way to the Senegal River and beyond to Northern modern-day Senegal. 
However, the frontiers stretching from Oued Noun to Cap Boujdour remained constant and unchanged under the rule of all successive dynasties, including the Marinids and the Wattassids. Throughout history, the strip stretching south to Cap Boujdour and east beyond Tindouf and Twat was part and parcel of the Moroccan Makhzen (Moroccan rule). This depth is the basis of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara, which is a historical, political, cultural, geographical, and geostrategic. The strong bond between Morocco and its African depth, which dates as far back as the Almoravids and stretches over time till the Spanish colonization that started in the 1880s, is the historical sediment of Morocco’s legitimate claim over Western Sahara. It is the essence and the basis of the legitimate presence of Morocco in Western Sahara.

158,"Geography Is Destiny, History is the Will of Nations: Spain and Morocco and the Shared Leap Towards the Future","What distinguishes the relationship between Morocco and Spain is that the time factor (i.e. history), which, when added to geography, both create a destiny of tectonic dimensions.",Lahcen Haddad,"May 09, 2022 10:44 a.m.","Rabat - Readers of the history of relations between Morocco and Spain, over at least thirteen centuries, are fascinated by a vast “body” of events, battles, wars, conquests, colonialism, emancipation in addition to the recently crafted economic, social and cultural overlap. A complex relationship that extends beyond geography and history to the shared present and an ineluctable future governed by the need for coexistence and cohabitation in an extended space that is one of the most geo-strategically sensitive regions of the World.
In his famous speech to the Canadian Senate on 17 May 1961, John Fitzgerald Kennedy told Canadians: "" “Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder. What unites us is far greater than what divides us.”
This statement applies perfectly to Morocco and Spain because as Abraham Verghese, the American writer and physician at Stanford University, said, ""geography is Destiny"". Spain and Morocco not only found themselves embroiled over time in a long and free-wheeling history of invasions, wars, battles, conquests and liberations, but were able since the seventies of the 20th Century to transcended animosity and build a creative model of cooperation, using the maritime borders, the seas and the common view of the Straits of Gibraltar as an opportunity to thrive and prosper together. 
What distinguishes the relationship between Morocco and Spain is that the time factor (i.e. history), which, when added to geography, both create a destiny of tectonic dimensions that concerns what Fernand Braudel, co-founder of the French school of the Annales, the ""long duration"", that is to say the immobile time which transcends generations and events and is part of the slow evolution of peoples in relation to the landscape, geography and ecology (Fernand Braudel, “La longue durée”, Annales, Vol. 13, no 4, 1958.)
If history in its Hegelian sense is an intelligent process and a movement towards a new status or condition, i.e. ""human freedom"" (""Lessons in the Philosophy of History"" 1837), the power of geography is to give an ecological, cultural and political dimension to geostrategic proximity and “untranscendable” “thereness”.
Spain's emancipation from fascism after the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975 and Morocco's liberation from colonial rule from 1956 to 1975, can be seen as a watershed in the history of the two countries and in the history of their relations. The entry of the two countries into the era of “freedom” (freedom from dictatorship for Spain and freedom from colonialisms for Morocco) at the same period accelerated the use of geography as a gateway to cooperation and partnership.
History evolves according to a certain momentum that coalesces events that are controlled by the actors and others that are part of the inevitable process of things both human and natural, creating a structural transformation that turns things upside down. This change, in the case of Morocco and Spain, occurred in this period of parallel emancipation (from dictatorship and colonialism), which was a milestone in the history of the two countries and a milestone in the history of their relations. 
Over the past 40 years, relations have developed in such a way that Spain has become Morocco's leading trade partner (ahead of France, which remains Morocco's leading economic partner); Morocco has become Spain's leading trade partner in Africa, the turnover of trade between the two countries amounts to € 16 billion; the number of Spanish companies operating in Morocco exceeds 1,000; Moroccan tourism in Spain generates approximately € 1 billion; and the value of Spanish tourism in Morocco can be estimated at around € 1.2 billion. Three million Moroccans residing abroad cross Spain every year to go back to Morocco, contributing thereby around € 1 billion to the Spanish economy; not to mention the 700,000 Moroccans residing in Spain, who take part in building the Spanish economy, while transferring part of their income to their families in Morocco.
At the security level, dozens of terrorist cells have been dismantled in Spain and Morocco, as a result of the exemplary cooperation between the security forces of both countries; exchange of information and joint operations, added to cooperation with third countries, has been instrumental in the fight against terrorism, extremism, organized and cross-border crime. 
Tens of thousands of immigration attempts have been thwarted by Moroccan security services. Uncurbed migration attempts here and there should not obscure Morocco's efforts to protect its borders and those of Europe from illegal migration. The cost of such an endeavor is around half a billion euros a year, with help from the EU that does not exceed a total of € 300 million since 2006, a mere € 18 million a year.
There are those who want to weave another story, a narrative of a different and alternative kind. They are the Podemos and the Spanish far left, who support the separatist thesis of the Polisario, in addition to some disgruntled journalists who still cling to the myth of an Algerian revolution and its enfant terrible, the “Polisario revolution in the sand.” They still blame Morocco for the victory of Mohamed Ben Abdelkarim Al-Khattabi in the battle of Anwal in the summer of 1921 and consider the Moroccans who participated with Franco in his war against the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) as a fifth column mobilized by Morocco (who was by the way, ironically enough, colonized then by both France and Spain) to help Spanish fascism. They also see the Green March (1975) as Moroccan blackmail of Spain while Franco was in bed dying, which led to the removal of the Sahara from Spain at a time of political and constitutional weakness. 
For all this, they conclude that Algeria and the Polisario front should be supported and Morocco weakened; they applaud the creation of a permanent tension with the “backward” and fundamentally undemocratic country of Morocco; “they are moros, anayway!”
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's announcement that Morocco's autonomy proposal was the most serious, realistic and credible basis for resolving the Sahara conflict has been a mortal blow to this narrative. The response was therefore violent from opponents of the Moroccan-Spanish rapprochement. They see the realism of the Spanish position as a development that will most certainly weaken their thesis. They were betting on the continuation of tensions between the two countries, a situation that would bring Spain closer to Algeria and accelerate the dream of an independent state in the Moroccan Sahara.
However, the Establishment in Spain (including the Army and the security apparatuses), the private sector, along with the Governments at both national and local levels, see in the relaunch of strategic relations between the two countries not only an investment in the future, in the security of Europe, in the prosperity of Ceuta and Melilla (the occupied Moroccan cities), the Canary Islands, Andalusia and others, but a normalization that is in harmony with the history and power of geography to embody the Spanish-Moroccan dream--the dream of an extended space for economic integration, security cooperation and the common development of the two countries' maritime and natural assets. The dream of the two peoples for prosperity and sustained growth in a promising and welcoming space of security and stability triumphed. Hope won over apathy and pessimism.

159,Does the Fertilizer Industry Need a Morocco-Led OPEC Alternative?,"With a volatile market for both fertilizer and its inputs, Morocco and other fertilizer-producing countries could unite to stabilize the market.",Jasper Hamann,"May 07, 2022 6:07 p.m.","Rabat - As the global economy goes through a turbulent period marked by a worldwide scramble for fertilizers and their ingredients, Morocco and other key producers could benefit from an OPEC-style alliance to stabilize global prices. 
The global market for fertilizers is undergoing severe disruptions, first caused by global supply-chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then worsened by the conflict in Ukraine. With key supplies of inputs and fertilizer itself under threat, governments around the world are scrambling to find new supplies of this important commodity.
Fertilizers are a key element in ensuring global food security, and have led to a vast population increase worldwide that now depend on it to maintain affordable food prices. 
The impact of the global fertilizer market on food prices for consumers has become a frontpage issue in recent months, in particular after the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, two key suppliers of both agricultural output such as wheat, and the chemicals required to make fertilizers.
Price volatility
Fertilizers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, often tailored to the specific soil and crop available to farmers. From corporate potato farmers in France to small-scale coffee plantations in Indonesia, everyone needs a regular supply of fertilizers in order to grow their crops.
Some countries have resorted to drastic measures to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers in recent years. Sri Lanka is a prime example. 
The country decided to opt for an approach that would demand the use of organic fertilizers, yet the measure has brought a myriad of issues, including difficulties sourcing reliable organic material, while local farmers and experts worry about future yields. 
Most countries recognize that there is little choice in the matter. Current population levels require chemical fertilizers, and governments are often blamed when fertilizer supplies run dry. 
India is a fine example of the political implications of fertilizer shortages. The South Asian country’s political scene regularly turns into a circular firing squad whenever farmers complain about fertilizer prices. Local politicians blame the national government, experts blame economists, while local farmers are left bewildered and angry.
Amid fluctuating prices, COVID-19 disruptions and concerns over Eastern European supplies, the fertilizer market is set to continue to see rising prices, likely for years to come.
Essential resource
While our global economic system generally prefers to depend on the free market to correct prices based on supply and demand, the importance of a stable fertilizer supply leads many countries to introduce vast domestic subsidy-schemes in order to keep fertilizers affordable.
The vital importance of fertilizers to people around the world could lead to calls to find a more structural solution to market volatility. Just as with the most traded commodity on earth, oil, fertilizer supplies are essential to keep our modern world going.
Based on this primary need, fertilizer-producing countries like Morocco could be facing a unique opportunity, where the global importance of their industry is recognized like no time before.
These countries could take inspiration from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the stabilizing impact it has had on global oil markets. This alliance of oil-producing countries is able to control global oil prices by using its vast spare capacity to either increase or decrease production.
While OPEC remains controversial in times of high oil prices, few experts would discount the stabilizing effect the intergovernmental organization has had on global markets. While commentators might lament when the organization chooses not to use its power, few other resources have the available option to swiftly change the balance of supply and demand.
OFEC?
At a time when fertilizer supplies are a genuine threat to global food security, impacting consumers around the world, fertilizer-producing countries could step in to bring a sense of stability to the market. 
Similar to the model of OPEC, Morocco and other key producers could band together, and leverage their control over the supply of fertilizers to keep this valuable resource available to farmers around the globe.
Such an organization could help ensure a steady supply of fertilizers, stabilize prices at a sustainable level, and alleviate worries over a supply crunch that could leave millions facing malnutrition or starvation.
Such an organization could negate the current, desperate scramble for fertilizer supplies that has led to countries such as Brazil to skirt sanctions amid a search for potential new suppliers. It could bring together key producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers in the US, China, and India with key phosphate-rich countries such as Morocco.
Morocco in particular could be a potential leader of such a new organization, as it holds over 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves.
OPEC’s stabilizing effects are one reason why its cartel-like practices are generally accepted. Another reason is its unique symbiotic relationship with the US. 
With governments around the world currently seeing the importance of their fertilizer supply, and the possible political ramifications of shortages, such a symbiosis between fertilizer producers and consumers could suddenly emerge like never before.
Benefits for Morocco
If Morocco and others chose to step in to bring down fertilizer prices and ensure steady supplies, the effects of a more stable market would benefit a range of stakeholders, from end-consumers to the farmers who produce our food.
Morocco’s vast reserves could guarantee the country a significant role in such an organization due to its unmatched reserves and its geopolitical position between Europe, Africa, and the Arab world. 
Morocco’s current focus on sustainability in its New Development Model, as well as its climate commitments, could provide another key benefit: the exchange of agricultural technology and knowledge. Africa in particular has vast arable land, yet often lacks the investment and knowledge to increase yields and incomes for farmers.
A collaborative alliance of key producers of fertilizers and their inputs could help direct much-needed funds toward capacity-building efforts and knowledge exchange, while ensuring farmers and their consumers do not fall victim to market volatility. 
Based on the current context of instability and uncertainty, Morocco could leverage its diplomatic and economic resources to work towards a stable future-proof fertilizer market. 
With prices at record highs, the current context could provide a unique moment when international needs could overrule potential fears of the future power of such an organization.

160,Midwives Save Lives and a Central Component of Health Systems,"When pregnant women in war torn areas cannot access health centers, midwives like Laila travel to remote areas and provide professional reproductive care services.",Luay Shabaneh,"May 06, 2022 10:16 a.m.","Laila, a Yemeni midwife from Abyan, had to walk for more than an hour after midnight in a dangerous journey to attend to a delivery in a neighborhood that was under attack: “This is what midwives do in such dangerous environment, they put their lives at risk to save other’s’ lives.” she said.
When Laila began to attend to the delivery, an airstrike hit right next to the house. The whole house shook. The woman who was about to give birth, panicked and tried to escape despite her suffering and pain, but the brave midwife managed the situation, calmed her down and ensured the safe delivery of a healthy baby.  
When pregnant women in war torn areas cannot access health centers, midwives like Laila travel to remote areas and provide professional reproductive care services. We should always recognize and appreciate midwives' contributions and bravery. This cadre of primary health care providers plays a pivotal role in decreasing maternal mortality particularly in humanitarian settings. 
Every pregnant woman deserves a safe delivery, and midwives are capable of providing this care, saving lives in the process. Giving birth safely, comfortably and conveniently at home or in clinics should not be a luxury, but a woman’s basic human right. Therefore, midwife-led reproductive and maternal care should be considered a central component of all health systems at all times, especially during emergencies and in situations of fragility. 
Midwives also serve as agents of change at the community level with high potential to effect positive behaviour change; they provide advice, care and support for women and their babies during pregnancy, labour and the early postnatal period. Moreover, they educate, empower and enable women to lead healthy lives and exercise their right to sexual and reproductive health.
Yet the Arab region has a shortage of 128,000 midwives, and hundreds of thousands of women and newborns continue to die each year during pregnancy and childbirth due to preventable complications and illnesses. These can be prevented if midwives are empowered and trained to provide proper antenatal, delivery and post-natal care services.  A recent study from 88 countries that account for the vast majority of the world’s maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirths concluded that universal coverage of midwife-delivered interventions could avert two-thirds of these deaths and save 4.3 million lives per year by 2035.
Every day, midwives stand by women when they are most vulnerable, they often risk their own lives to save pregnant women and newborns, they operate in different settings and during the toughest circumstances and are always on the frontlines to support childbearing women in order to ensure safe and healthy pregnancies, taking every precaution to protect the women they serve. However, they are often not included in emergency preparedness and response planning.
Midwives must be included in the national emergency preparedness planning, to ensure that midwifery is not overlooked when responding to crises and disasters. It is also essential for education and training curricula to include the provision of effective reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) care in a crisis.
Despite their role in the fight for the rights of women, children and communities, midwives often deprived of their own rights: to rest and self-care, to decent work and pay, and protection from discrimination. To achieve their full life-saving, health-improving, system-strengthening potential, midwives must be well educated, adequately trained, and appropriately regulated. They must also work in an environment that enables them to be effective.

161,Beware the Drums of War Echoing Through the Halls of Democracy,"The Ukraine conflict is being presented as a struggle of liberal democracies versus the rest of the world, resulting in calls for rapid escalation and confrontation.",Jasper Hamann,"Apr. 22, 2022 11:59 a.m.","Rabat - As someone who has spent the last few years living happily in Morocco, I finally briefly returned to Europe last week, where I was shocked to see the near-universal panic and push for war related to the Ukraine conflict. 
In the media, politics, and popular opinion, one narrative appears to be universally accepted, that the Russian offensive in Ukraine constitutes an imminent and clear threat to the current world order; democracy itself is being attacked and needs urgent intervention.
This has resulted in strange political trends. In the US the right-wing of the political sphere is pushing the center-left administration into further escalation and military action, while in the UK, the center-left  is pushing the right-wing administration to do the same. “The government is not doing enough against Putin’s aggression,” is the criticism shared by both US Republicans, and the UK Labour party alike, making for some very unlikely bedfellows.
An eerie consensus
Beautifully documented by American journalist Michael Tracy in a recent piece, democratic opposition parties across the West near-universally agree that the government is not doing enough, and call for further military action to cripple Russia once and for all.
Ironically, in western democracies, the anti-war narrative has become a narrative that calls for more direct military action, for vastly increased military spending and for flooding eastern Europe with advanced Western weaponry to support the Ukrainian resistance.
High-level officials in the UK have called for NATO to intervene directly by setting up a naval blockade to defend the Ukrainian port-city of Odessa. Meanwhile, many in the US press and political scene continue to call for the establishment of a “no fly zone” over Ukraine.
What these fairly abstract military terms really mean, few expand upon. Because a NATO naval blockade, or a no-fly zone, both imply that NATO forces would actively engage in combat with Russian military assets, by shooting down Russian planes, or attacking Russian navy vessels.
Throwing caution to the wind
What shocked me most during my brief time in Europe, is the growing consensus that it might be worth risking a possible third world war, in order to “teach Putin a lesson.” Russia’s incursion is being presented as a direct threat to democracies worldwide, which then turns into the conclusion that democracies must unite and urgently fight back.
The existential terms in which the renewed fighting in Ukraine are being presented stand in stark contrast to earlier Russian misdeeds against its neighbors. The fact that Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, or annexed Crimea in 2014, somehow did not meet this standard. 
Yet now the drums of war are emanating from every direction in the “free west.” The countries that promote freedom of speech and the open debate of ideas appear now to have produced a near universal consensus on the war, and any nuanced counter-arguments are quickly dismissed as “pro-Putin.”
From comedy shows to the evening news, the calls for a direct clash with nuclear-armed Russia are not just accepted, many seem to agree that democracies should have engaged in this clash much earlier. 
A threat to democracy?
When I tell my Moroccan friends or colleagues about the European consensus on Russia as an existential threat to democracy, many either smile or scoff.
After all, Morocco’s geopolitical “neighborhood,” has seen democracies tumble and creak over the past years. Since August 2019, West-Africa has seen six coup attempts, four of which successful, and two occurring in the same country. 
Democracies in the region have been regularly overthrown at gunpoint, yet few in the West have presented it as even a fraction as relevant as the conflict in Ukraine to the “rules based order” led by Western democracies. 
Ironically, it was the Western intervention in Libya that made possible many of the current coup attempts. 
The attempts to overthrow Muamar Ghaddafi and establish a new democracy in Libya led to the country being flooded with Western-funded weapons, while NATO airplanes assisted in crushing the Libyan air force. The aftermath of Ghaddafi’s swift overthrow however, constitutes what the CIA calls “blowback,” the unintended consequences of military intervention.
Small arms and well-trained fighters flooded into the Sahel and West-Africa, arms intended for Libyan fighters against Ghaddafi became the guns pointed at the heads of African democracies.
Blowback
The horrific consequences of a possible direct military confrontation between the “free West” and Russia cannot be underestimated, yet even the current military support for the Ukrainian resistance could constitute a greater threat to democracies than Russia ever could be.
What happens to the thousands of weapons being sent to Ukraine once this conflict inevitably dies down? And what happens to the thousands of experienced and trained fighters who will find themselves unemployed and potentially destitute after the silencing of the guns in Ukraine?
What is likely to occur, based on the patterns of recent history, is that those weapons will flow south, and create a new flint that could spark civil war and coup attempts far away from Europe’s borders. From politically unstable Lebanon to insurgents in Nigeria, a new influx of fighters and advanced weaponry could itself result in the crumbling of democracies.
When I have asked Europeans to look into what their countries have done, or could have done better, to prevent the current potentially apocalyptic stand-off with Russia, many appear flummoxed. The problem is the inherent evilness and war-hunger of Putin and the Russians, and democracies are simply responding to this threat, is the common response.
Deescalation
Yet few recognize that the only way to “influence” Russia’s part in the conflict is through potentially world-devastating war. Investigating what democracies can do to de-escalate the conflict and prevent another future stand-off is actually within the control of citizens of free democracies, and could result in a sustainable peace.
While the consequences of the current mindset in the democracies of the “rules based order” are uncertain, the current conflict is certainly a threat to democracy and stability. 
The irony is that it is not democracy in London or Washington that is under threat. The blow to democratic ideals incurred by this conflict are more likely to be felt in Beirut, Addis Ababa or Abuja. 
When the refugees of those potential conflicts arrive at Europe’s borders, will they be seen as victims of the struggle to protect democracy, and will they be received as Ukrainian refugees have been? 
In order to prevent such a calamity, a key role can be played by the group of countries who have not picked a side in the Ukraine conflict, the countries that are being depicted as an alliance of authoritarians by Western media and politicians. 
Those countries could call on the world to treat the Ukraine conflict as if it were a conflict between brown people, when the West seems to be able to be more neutral and devoid of emotion. In that case we could use the UN’s vast array of conflict-resolution mechanisms to stop the fighting, disarm irregular combatants, and establish a negotiated peace.
The question is whether we have already gone too far over the precipice, where deescalation is seen as defeat, and negotiations are seen as a missed chance to punish Russia once and for all. Only time will tell if calmer heads and nuanced solutions will prevail. For all our sakes, let's hope that they will.

162,Spanish Media and the Bankruptcy of the Anti-Moroccan Narrative,Spain’s change of heart on Western Sahara symbolizes the unraveling of hostile narratives targeting Morocco,Lahcen Haddad,"Apr. 15, 2022 10:49 a.m.","The decision by the Spanish Government on March 18, 2022 to recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara and declare the Autonomy Plan proposed by Morocco to be credible and a solid basis for a solution to the Western Sahara conflict angered quite a few journalists and media outlets in Spain.
It is surprising that these opinion leaders should be against peace and a win/win solution in the Sahara and against a normalization of relations between Spain and its southern neighbor with whom it shares borders, seas, history, geography, a booming trade, millions of tourists, investments, security concerns, migration headaches, resident and transiting migrant workers etc.
It is strange that some Spanish media and journalists do not see the benefits of a partnership of peace and prosperity between Spain and Morocco. They seem to revel when the tension was at its height over the last few months, especially since the (not so) secret admission to Spain of Morocco’s enemy Number One, Brahim Ghali, who happens to be accused of genocide and crimes against humanity by Sahrawis living in Tindouf, Moroccan Sahara and Spain.
We need to dig deeper to understand why some Spanish media and journalists prefer tension over peace, partnership and good neighborhood relations between Spain and Morocco. The anti-Moroccan reflex of these opinion leaders comes from an atavistic anti-Moorish attitude that has sedimented in the psyche of some Spaniards over the centuries, since the Muslim conquest (in the 8th Century) and up till La Reconquista (13th -15th Centuries). But this resentment resurged with force after the debacle of the Spanish Army at the hands of the guerrilla forces of Mohamed Ben Abdelkrim El Kahttabi in the “Annual” Battle in July-August 1921.
Quite a few Spaniards see it as a form of humiliation but rare are those who see it as a liberation act led by indigenous Moroccan tribes against a colonial force that nobody invited to occupy the northern part of the Charifian Kingdom. “Annual” still resonates in the psyche of so many of these opinion leaders as a sign of Morocco’s untrustworthiness and treachery, repeating the same colonial dogma of “ungrateful indigenous populations” biting the civilizing hand of colonialism.

Fifteen years later, the Spanish civil war broke out. Francisco Franco had crossed from Northern Morocco to Spain to fight Spanish republicans, helped by Moroccan mercenaries who joined his army for pure economic reasons; these individuals acted alone knowing that they could earn more as soldiers than as laborers. Some Spaniards still think that Morocco helped Franco win and therefore abort the victory of the democratic forces against fascism.
Very few would want to admit that at that time Morocco was colonized by the French and the Spanish, did not have any army, and the role of the Sultan (the King) was merely symbolic with no powers whatsoever. But it is a convenient narrative; it fits within the grand picture of Morocco as a scheming foe trying to undo Spanish sovereign nation-building aspirations.
On October 16, 1975, the International Court of Justice ruled that there were legal ties (of allegiance) between Western Sahara and Morocco. The same day, Hassan II called for Moroccans to organize a peaceful march towards Western Sahara to put an end to Spanish colonialism. At that very time, Franco was in bed agonizing leaving a vacuum of power, since as a dictator he had centralized all the powers of decision within the Spanish state. Spanish anti-Moroccan opinion leaders cried and are still crying wolf: “Morocco used Franco’s agony to humiliate Spain;” “Spain would never leave Western Sahara had Franco not been in his death bed;” “Morocco is at it again trying to build the Grand Maghrib of the Middle Ages;” “Morocco’s blackmail of Spain is at work again” etc.
A pure coincidence of events was turned into a narrative of blackmail and treachery. Nobody among these has ever mentioned that documents and testimonies showed that Franco was ready to negotiate the retrocession of Western Sahara to Morocco at the time of the Left-wing Government of Abdallah Ibrahim (December 24 1958- May 21, 1960) but internal tensions and truf wars between the then Crown Prince (who became King Hassan II in February 26, 1961) and the National Movement and calculations as to who will reap the benefits of such a liberation of the Sahara came in the way and prevented a deal when Franco was in good health.
The retrocession of by Spain of Terfaya in1958, of Sidi-Ifni in 1969, the fact that Morocco was the first to register Western Sahara as a self-non governing territory with the UN Commission on Decolonization in 1963-4 do not matter if the intention is to paint Spain as “the good guy” and Morocco as the “bad guy”, as in a historical cheap and sentimental melodrama. None of the Spanish media cared to mention the attacks of the Moroccan Liberation Army (MLA) in 1957-58 on regions in Western Sahara which led to a joint operation by French and Spanish armies called “Ecouvillon” in February 1958 whose mission was to thwart the advance of the MLA. It just does not fit within the grand scheme of the Moroccan conspiracy against Spain.
Nobody has ever even mentioned that the Polisario was formed by Sahrawi students in Rabat in 1971-1972 in Rabat. El-Ouali Moustapha Sayed and his friends were dreaming of the Western Sahara being liberated as a Moroccan territory; they contacted political party leaders (especially the Nationalist Movement and leftwing parties) but were completely scorned off by the latter.
In June 1972, they marched in TanTan to claim the Moroccanness of the Sahara and were brutally repressed by the security forces at the time of General Oufkir’s stronghold on security apparatuses as Minister of Interior. Faithful to his Nasserite Arab nationalist dreams, Hassan II’s nemesis, Muammar Gaddafi, who was adamant about toppling the Moroccan monarchy, heard of them and invited them to Tripoli. Encouraged, armed and funded by Gaddafi, the Polisario became an independence movement way after its first congress in Ain Ben Tili, a small village-fort in northeast Mauritania, part the Tiris Zemmour region, on May 10, 1973.
Algeria did not come into the picture till after the Green March and when it saw that the Polisario had arms, logistical support and organizational capability, all lavishly provided for by Colonel Gaddafi. None of these details matter to the above-mentioned Spanish opinion leaders’ selective and anti-Moroccan approach to the Western Sahara question. The narrative is nicely woven to picture Morocco as blackmailer and Spain as a victim. This is usual colonial rhetoric at its best where a reversal of roles is always a recourse to justify the colonial act: the colonizer becomes a victim and the colonized the oppressor.

The fact that Algeria became party to the conflict despite Algerian President Haouari Boumedienne’s recorded assurances in October 1974, at the occasion of the Arab Summit in Rabat, that Western Sahara is a Moroccan-Mauritanian issue, is so convenient for the anti-Moroccan rhetoric of some Spanish media and opinion leaders. Algeria was considered then by the European and Spanish Left and opinion leaders to be a progressive country embarking upon an agrarian revolution, autonomous management (à la Tito) and state-of-the-art industrialization.
The Algerian Revolution was delivering on its revolutionary promises. Morocco, on the contrary, was backwards, tyrannical and monarchic (i.e. old school) anyway. While Algeria was showered with praise and adoration, Morocco was bombarded with criticism and patronizing political rhetoric. The Polisario became a darling of Spanish and European left-wing media and militants because it symbolized an “Algerian Revolution in the Sands.” The revolutionary romanticism in support of Algeria and the Polisario rimed beautifully with the struggle against the remnants of Spanish fascism as embodied in the successive aborted coups of elements of the Spanish Army against the fledgling democracy.
When the Algerian Revolution turned later against its children and the Agrarian Reform as well as the Industrialization program became mere mirages and even nightmares that resulted in a bloody civil war in the nineties and the military strong grip on the institutional landscape, Spanish (and with them some European) opinion leaders put Algeria in the backburner and concentrated on attacking Morocco. The Polisario’s bleak human rights record, its embezzlement of humanitarian aid, its use of child soldiers, its illegal administration of the Tindouf Camps, and Algeria’s refusal to count and to identify the Sahrawi “refugees” (which Morocco considers Moroccans held against their will) on its territory should not matter, if Morocco is shown under a bad day.
What disturbs them is the striking economic and political advances in Morocco: the economy has tripled in 20 years; poverty was reduced to less than 3 per cent; Morocco is the second investor in Africa; infrastructure programs are transforming the connectivity landscape; mega projects are ushering in a new era of regional leadership; the Parliament is becoming more critical of government and accountability is working; notable advances on the human rights front… “How come”? “The Monarchical system is delivering in Morocco whereas the memory of the Algerian Revolution is bringing forth the worst in the Algerian Establishment.” “Something is wrong!” “It can’t be!”
“Eureka! Eureka!” “We found it!” Morocco is not really developing its economy and improving the livelihood of its people, but is malevolently trying to recreate the Grand Morocco of the Middle Ages that stretches all the way from the Senegal River, and includes Southern and Western Algeria, Western Sahara, Northern Morocco, Andalucía, all the way to the southern borders of Leon, Navarre and Castile.” A grand scheme indeed. For quite a few Spanish opinion leaders, “that is why some Moroccans still consider Mauritania and Eastern Sahara Moroccan Provinces, and why all Moroccans are unanimous on annexing Western Sahara and getting back Ceuta and Melilla, and why the Parliament has voted a law in 2018 to delimit maritime borders that may go beyond the Canary Islands.”
It all fits in. The picture is complete. But the change is interesting: from combating a backward country led by a traditional monarchy, while the alternative is there in the Algerian Revolution and its promises, to preserving Spanish sovereignty from a beguiling foe that has shown in the distant past (Middle Ages) and not so distant past (Annual, the Spanish Civil War and the Green March) that it could harm the very fabric of the Spanish nation.
Homi Bhabha talks of “nation and narration”; here, Spanish opinion leaders create an imaginary narrative of an imaginary foe to fend off an imaginary threat to the nation. Students of conspiracy theories understand well this shift: Jaron Harambam and Stef Aupers called it the movement from the “unbelievable” to the “undeniable” (""From the Unbelievable to the Undeniable: Epistemological Pluralism, or How Conspiracy Theorists Legitimate their Extraordinary Truth Claims"". European Journal of Cultural Studies. SAGE Publications. 24 (4): 990–1008). It is not about the truthfulness of whether Morocco is conspiring to recreate the Grand Morocco but everything fits in a perfect scheme since Annual (July-August 1921) up till the “migration blackmail of Ceuta of May 2021”, 100 years later. The stretch is unbelievable but the truth is undeniable.
Therefore, the tension with Morocco after the strange and “film noir” admission of the notorious Brahim Ghali into Spain was welcome by the anti-Moroccan media and opinion leaders in Spain. Continuous tension will prove that Morocco is always in a blackmail logic, will thwart any attempt to make Morocco and Spain politically agree on geostrategic issues like the Western Sahara, maritime borders and Ceuta and Melilla, because there is no end as to what Morocco, who revels in an expansionist existential state of mind, would ask. Tension will keep Morocco at bay, will delay a permanent denouement and normalization of relations; in the meantime, good relations with Algeria and the Polisario will help keep the conflict in Western Sahara aflame and Morocco busy and weak; and if Western Sahara becomes independent, so much the better, because Morocco will be contained and reduced to a more manageable size.
The Spanish Government’s decision to recognize the sovereignty of Morocco over Western Sahara pulverized this nicely woven and conspiracy-based narrative. Political dialogue with Morocco is possible; partnership could be hoisted to higher levels; trade with Ceuta and Melilla will reopen; Andalusia will continue to benefit from high end tourism on the part of affluent Moroccan tourists; more than a thousand Spanish firms will continue to make money in Morocco; more than three million Moroccans will continue to cross Spain to come back home in the summer. And more than 700 thousand Moroccans will continue to help with rebuilding the Spanish economy after years of slow growth.
This is too much for doomsayers who prefer animosity and tension over good neighborhood and mutually beneficial partnership. It is true that their narrative has been debunked by the forces of the future on both sides of the Gibraltar Straits but more should be done so that this process is ineluctably irreversible. Hope is the best antidote not only to atavistic anti-Moroccanism but is the best we could do to generations on both banks of the Mediterranean who aspire for peace in a world ridden with the plagues of war, strife and terror. The antidote to tacit anti-“moros” racism, covert bigotry, fear of the other is hope, shared prosperity and long-lasting peace.

163,Morocco's Generational Divide on Full Display at BBC Recording,"When it comes to perceptions on freedom of speech in Morocco, the old and young see things very differently",Jasper Hamann,"Apr. 07, 2022 3:06 p.m.","Rabat - On the night of April 6 a mixed crowd of Anglophone Moroccans and expats gathered in Rabat for a panel discussion hosted by British broadcaster the BBC and the British Council. Hosted by veteran reporter Jonny Dymond at the glamorous Hassan Tower Hotel in Rabat, a panel of four Moroccan  experts provided a lively discussion about Morocco’s future. 
Yet one issue in particular appeared to unite the panel, while noticeably dividing the audience: freedom of speech in Morocco.
Earlier, the panel had discussed topics such as drought and desalination, gender issues, political engagement and other hot topics vital to Morocco’s future. Each topic elicited a variety of opinions from the panel, made up of USFP politician Khaoula Lachguar, civil society actor Manal Elattir, former government spokesperson Mustapha El Khalfi and current Minister Younes Sekkouri.
While all topics drew a relatively muted response from the audience, the topic of freedom of speech in Morocco appeared to truly energize the crowd after over an hour of polite debate. 
Freedom of speech: progress or problem?
The BBC’s format for the discussion dictated that an audience-member ask the panel a question to start discussion on each topic. When it came to freedom of speech, a young Moroccan man mentioned that he continued to face legal action over a three-year old Facebook post in which he had criticized the government.
The young man’s question silenced the audience, while the panel responded by highlighting the progress made on the topic over the past three decades, while all panelists seemed to agree that the issue of freedom of speech was not a main concern in Morocco.
For the first time in the evening, the remarks sparked a strong reaction from the crowd, as a large number of young people raised their hand to speak on the issue. 
What followed was a flurry of responses that highlighted a lingering divide between the perspective of mainstream politicians and those of many well-educated urban young Moroccans. 
One person stood up to mention that many young Moroccans see leaving the country as their only hope, while others shared their opinions and feelings on what they clearly saw as a hot-button issue in Moroccan society.
The uniformity of the panel’s response on the issue contrasted with the vibrant and emotional reactions shared by primarily young Moroccans who expressed feeling alienated and oppressed by the current status quo on freedom of speech and its effect on the country’s media and public dialogue.
The panel discussion, which will be broadcast on the BBC World Service on April 9, is likely to spark further debate on the issue among its millions of listeners, and Moroccans in particular.
Generational divide
The jolt of energy that ran through the audience last night to me reveals a lingering disconnect between Morocco’s mainstream political class and particularly educated urban youth. 
Like everywhere else in the world, young urban professionals and students represent the most progressive individuals in society, often contrasting wildly with the opinions of more conservative rural communities. In Morocco, the sub-group of Anglophone Moroccans likely represent the most progressive ideals even among the country’s urban youth.
Yet this global phenomenon appears to not fully explain last night’s disagreement, revealing an unspoken generational divide in Moroccan society.
This divide in many ways is logical. For older Moroccans, the current status quo on freedom of speech is a breath of fresh air and an unprecedented level of freedom compared to the “years of lead,” a time period of state repression that lasted for decades, and still lingers in the minds of many who experienced it.
While older Moroccans compare Morocco’s current levels of freedom of speech to those difficult years, younger  -especially internationally-minded- Moroccans instead compare the issue to the situation in the more mature democracies of many Western states.
Mending the divide
As a Westerner myself, I would like to emphasize that even in the most liberal countries, the idea of full freedom of speech is also still more of an ideal than a reality. 
The political concept of the “overton window” neatly explains the metaphorical window in which ideas in the West are determined to be either realistic or radical, a key indicator whether a new idea has any chance of being taken seriously by national politicians. 
A key difference between the West’s approach and the issue highlighted by young Moroccans during last night’s BBC event, is that espousing “radical” ideas in the West rarely means facing legal repercussions from the state.
Western states can prosecute speech, and do so for similar reasons as in Morocco, namely speech that is deemed a threat to society or risks violence. 
The issue with Morocco appears to be that it simply defines “threats” differently. And in my opinion, this assessment is based on an outdated perception of Morocco’s internal stability.
Free speech, a threat or an asset?
Morocco is genuinely developing and improving, both internally and on the international stage. The country’s growing prosperity and continued political stability means the country no longer needs to fear threats as much, especially the “threat” of public discontent.
No democracy has a citizenry that fully agrees on all topics, or supports all of the government’s policies. In many ways, opposition and critique to government policies drives positive change, pushes politicians to explain their ideas and builds a feeling of a shared project between citizen and government. 
The irony is that Moroccan politicians do not have to fear the public, or their opinions. 
Vast national efforts to expand social support and healthcare are set to solidify the social contract in the long-term. In the short-term, the new government has the opportunity to revolutionize its public communication and display its ability to discuss strong critiques, present data and elaborate on plans without feeling threatened by diverging opinions.
It is a sense of self-confidence in Morocco’s mission and vision that should empower politicians to embrace intense public debate. Citizens do not expect that the government obeys them, they simply need to feel that their voices are heard, and considered in the public debate.
Morocco’s strong response to COVID-19 and its positive outlook for a sustainable economic recovery should empower Moroccan politicians to welcome dissent and value critics in order to gradually remove the government’s fear of opposing opinions. 
These efforts in turn can remove feelings of repression among the public and build confidence that Morocco’s future is in all of our hands.
Listening to critique does not present a weakness, it instead shows the strength and resilience of Moroccan society and its unique multicultural and international values. 
In the end, we all share both rights and responsibilities in making sure there is a bright future for everyone living in Morocco. That future is possible, and simply requires us to trust in one another, and welcome dissenting opinions as a valuable and patriotic contribution towards our shared project of improving and defending the country we love.

164,"Sahara: Spain’s Endorsement of Morocco Is a Moment of Truth for EU, France",Spain’s newly-announced position on the Sahara conflict has given renewed vigor to the increasingly prevailing notion that Morocco’s plan is the best route to a lasting solution.,Samir Bennis,"Apr. 05, 2022 10:54 a.m.","Washington DC - Whichever way you slice it, the Spanish decision to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara constitutes the most critical of all the recent diplomatic and political developments on the Sahara question. 
In addition to being of great, unprecedented historical importance -- this being the first time that a European country has supported the Moroccan settlement plan with such clarity and frankness -- the move will have significant geostrategic implications for the future of the conflict.   
That Spain was the occupying state of the Moroccan Sahara until 1975; that it signed an accord with Morocco in which it agreed to return the Sahara to its mother country; and that it never vetoed this agreement makes Madrid’s newfound position particularly important and an even greater boost to the Moroccan position.  
Meanwhile, it goes without saying that, for Algeria, the Spanish decision is a disastrous development for two umbilically linked reasons. First, Madrid’s support for Rabat is a painful reminder of the failure of Algerian diplomat’s tireless efforts to sabotage or at least contain the undeniably pro-Moroccan momentum Western Sahara-related diplomacy has witnessed in the past decade. 
Second, not only as Algeria lost in Spain an erstwhile accomplice with which it used to collude to undermine Moroccan interests, but the domino effect the Spanish decision is sure to set in motion constitutes a devastating blow to Algeria’s dreams of regional hegemony.
A sign of things to come
While the Algerian regime might have failed to foresee the calamitous ramifications of its ill-advised decision to terminate the contract of the Europe-Maghreb pipeline, Algerian diplomats should at least be discerning enough to know that Madrid’s siding with Rabat is the harbinger of more similar things to come. 
If nothing else, the Spanish decision will push many countries, especially in Europe and Latin America, to think of following in Spain’s footsteps. In particular, the move is sure to put unprecedented diplomatic pressure on France, the other country with historical responsibility in the genesis of the Sahara conflict.
Although France has been supporting the Moroccan proposal for fifteen years, Paris’s endorsement of the Moroccan position has never been as clear or explicit as the newly-announced Spanish stance. Rather, France has long contented itself with rehashing the pro-Morocco language the UN Security Council has been using since 2007. 
France has never said that the Moroccan plan is the most realistic, credible, and serious solution to the Sahara dispute. Instead, born of an apparent desire to sufficiently satisfy Morocco without completely alienating Algeria, the French position is that the Autonomy Plan constitutes “a realistic and credible” proposal. 
We know the well-documented significance of language -- in life as in politics. In political and diplomatic discourse especially, each word carries stupendous weight and the choice of definite or indefinite articles is pregnant with meaning, political significance. To say that the Moroccan Autonomy Plan is “a realistic and credible” proposal is not remotely the same as saying that it is “the most credible, most realistic and serious plan.” 
In the first instance, the speaker leaves the door open to another plan or proposal that may also be “realistic and credible.”  While in the second, which Spain’s Prime Minister used in his letter to King Mohammed VI on March 18, there is no room for any other interpretation. 
For the second speaker, thus, the hailed plan is the only game in town; it is either that plan or nothing. What does that leave us with regarding the issue at hand? This: Whereas Spain used to think like France in applauding Morocco’s plan while leaving the door of credibility and realism open to Algeria’s call for a self-determination referendum, Madrid now believes the Moroccan plan is the only viable route to a lasting solution to the Sahara conflict. 
This shift in the Spanish position -- which I consider a logical development of the Spanish position during the past two decades, given that Spain has moderately supported the Moroccan Autonomy Plan since 2008 -- is widely expected to put European Union countries in front of a dreadful, terrifying truth for many: Morocco’s proposal is the best and only way toward peace, prosperity, and stability in Western Sahara. 
The EU’s time for reckoning
As such, if the EU is serious about sincerely contributing to solving the Sahara conflict, and if it genuinely wishes to strengthen its relations with Morocco on the basis of mutual respect,  it should consider expressing its clear and unequivocal support for the Autonomy Plan. 
Such a strong declaration of support would be the first step in the right direction of furthering essential cooperation between Brussels and Rabat. More than that, however, it would also constitute a vital corroboration of the line of realism and compromise the UN Security resolutions has clearly embraced in all its Sahara conflict-related resolutions since 2007. 
Since 2018 especially, the UN consensus around the Sahara question has been to disqualify an unworkable and impractical self-determination referendum in favor of a realistic, practical, feasible, and compromise-based political solution.  
So, will EU countries follow in Spain's footsteps and recognize the importance of the Sahara for Morocco and Moroccans? And are they willing to stop hiding behind vague and ambiguous declarations to actually, vigorously acknowledge the unanimity that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan has secured in the past decade? 
Judging from the media statement the EU issued yesterday, in which it expressed its satisfaction with the normalization of relations between Morocco and Spain, I think the European bloc is not yet ready to discard its “positive neutrality” posture on the Sahara question to explicitly recognize the unparalleled centrality of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. 
Still, if Algeria’s feverish, ballistic response to Spain’s change of position is any indication, the upcoming months and years will see the Moroccan plan gain much wider currency among diplomats in general and UN negotiators in particular. 
In this sense, Spain’s decision has made crystal clear what the US’ December 10 recognition had symbolically, though meaningfully, pointed to: That for anyone genuinely interested in preserving security, stability, and peace in an already fragile Sahel-Saharan region, Morocco’s plan is the only way forward.

165,Western Sahara: Why Spain Chose to Support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan,"Morocco’s inflexibility in recent diplomatic tensions, the declining importance of Algerian gas, and Moroccan diplomacy’s growing advances all led to Spain’s historic U-turn.",Samir Bennis,"Mar. 24, 2022 2:52 p.m.","Washington DC  - Spain has assumed its historic role on the Sahara question by unequivocally embracing Morocco's Autonomy Plan as the only and best way out of the long-running conflict over the region. And in so doing, Madrid might have also paved the way for other European countries that have been concealing their reluctance to pick Morocco’s side behind vague, ambiguous statements of “positive neutrality.”
To Morocco, meanwhile, the Spanish government’s decision means the era of grandiloquent speeches unsupported by concrete actions is over. Having learned from the recent diplomatic crisis that has considerably damaged its once friendly and strategic relationship with Morocco, Spain appears determined to treat its southern neighbor with due respect, taking into account its interests and concerns.
Morocco: an assertive regional leader
Following the serious diplomatic rift that started between the two neighbors in April of last year, Rabat was adamant that the re-establishment of relations with Madrid could only be done on the basis of a more solid foundation of mutual respect, loyalty, and transparency. 
This Moroccan position was clearly stated in King Mohammed VI's speech commemorating the 46th anniversary of the Green March last November. Despite its willingness to turn the page with Madrid and other Western partners to embark on a new era of sincere and solid friendship, the King said, Morocco would not sign any strategic agreements with countries maintaining ambiguous or ambivalent positions on the Sahara issue. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez showed great courage and wisdom in sending the Moroccan King the letter that announced Spain’s historic adoption of a position that favors the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. 
Unambiguously siding with Morocco was no small feat for the Spanish leader, given that significant sectors of Spain’s public opinion are strongly sympathetic to the Polisario Front’s narrative. And the virulence with which many Spanish commentators have since attacked their country’s support for Morocco’s Sahara stance gives some indication of the audacity it took Sanchez to break with Madrid's historical ambivalence on the Sahara. 
To a certain extent, the wisdom and lucidity of Sanchez's decision should be seen as reflecting his country’s recognition, albeit belated, of the new geopolitical winds prevailing in the Mediterranean region. Morocco's regional influence has prodigiously grown in recent years, with the North African country becoming a regional -- African, to be more precise -- power that now insists on reciprocity and mutual respect in relations with its Western allies. 
This is particularly relevant to Moroccan-Spanish ties. And Sanchez’s letter to King Mohammed VI suggests that Madrid has finally resigned itself to the truth that maintaining good, solid relations with Morocco is key to preserving a large part of its economic and security interests. 
Spain's new, positive stance on Morocco's Autonomy Plan is therefore a clear recognition of Morocco's position as a harbor of stability and prosperity in the Maghreb. It also testifies to both Morocco's growing leadership in the emerging African geopolitical landscape, and -- most importantly -- the growing international consensus in favor of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. 
To be sure, Spain’s new stance does not amount to an explicit recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara. But the novelty is that, for the first time, Madrid recognizes the importance of the Sahara for Morocco, as well as the need to ""guarantee the stability, sovereignty, territory and prosperity of our countries."" As such, without explicitly endorsing the Moroccanness of the Sahara,  Spain has subtly acknowledged Morocco’s sovereignty over the region. 
Volte-face or logical evolution?
While it surely is a historic turning point, the Spanish government's decision to support the Moroccan autonomy initiative does not exactly represent a radical departure from tradition. 
Contrary to trendy suggestions in the Spanish media, Madrid's stance is not a U-turn, but rather a logical evolution of its position in the direction Morocco required and expected from a strategic ally. With Spain bearing considerable historical responsibility in the conflict, the country’s new decision could also be interpreted as a sort of reckoning with history.
Hosting his Moroccan counterpart Abass El Fassi in December 2008, the former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero expressed moderate support for Morocco's Autonomy Plan, praising Rabat’s ""serious and credible"" efforts to resolve the Sahara crisis. The then Spanish PM even added that the Moroccan initiative ""constitutes a positive contribution"" to the solution of the territorial conflict. 
In this, Zapatero's speech simply echoed the language used in UN Security Council resolutions since 2007, when Morocco presented its Autonomy Plan. Yet, although this Spanish position was not a clear endorsement of the Moroccan plan, it was welcomed in Rabat amidst a regional and international context that was back then far from being supportive of the Moroccan thesis. 
Spain maintained a position of “positive neutrality” even during the two terms of former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (2011-18). But things started going awry for Spain in 2018, with Pedro Sanchez coming to power in 2018 in a geopolitical context that was increasingly favorable to Morocco. 
Key in Spain’s decision to change some of its historical positions vis-a-vis Morocco was the sight of: Morocco reclaiming its leadership in Africa, becoming a key player in the Mediterranean region, and securing unprecedented international consensus around its Autonomy Plan. Madrid had to either embark on the new geopolitical boat of a boldly assertive Morocco or ignore reality and be swept away by overwhelmingly pro-Morocco diplomatic winds. 
However, at the moment of truth, when Morocco's position received a significant impetus with the American recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara, Spain failed to answer the call of history and chose instead to settle some scores with Morocco. 
The Spanish government broke its positive neutrality commitment with declarations that smacked of some sort of fundamental hostility to Morocco’s Western Sahara stance. A striking illustration of this was the then Spanish foreign minister’s tirade against the US recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over the Sahara. 
Faced with such dismissiveness from Spain, Morocco decided to postpone indefinitely the high-level Moroccan-Spanish meeting that was scheduled to be held in Rabat in December 2020. And things got out of hand between April and May 2021 after news emerged of Spain hosting the Polisario leader under a false identity. 
While many in Rabat had long expressed their dissatisfaction with Spain's duplicity on a number of highly sensitive and important issues for Morocco, Madrid’s decision to shelter Ghali and then shrug off Morocco’s complaints was a step too far.  
For Morocco, it was clear that Sanchez's government had broken a tacit agreement Rabat and Madrid signed in 2004.  Under that agreement, Morocco was to shelve its territorial claims over Ceuta and Melilla and instead strengthen cooperation with Spain in the fight against illegal immigration. In return, Madrid agreed to commit to a position of positive neutrality on the Sahara issue. 
Since then, although Spain’s official statements did not appear to support Morocco’s Sahara position, Spanish diplomats continued to endorse the Moroccan Autonomy Plan behind the scenes. 
In hindsight, it now seems this Ghali-linked 18 months-long diplomatic crisis was a necessary evil. Spain's newfound, unequivocal endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan is a step that Morocco had long been waiting -- and hoping -- for. 
In exchange for Spain’s new position, Morocco is likely to commit to alleviating the severe economic crisis that the two enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla have been witnessing since Rabat decided to close their borders more than two years ago. 
That does not mean, of course, that Morocco will agree to open up to the smuggling spout from the two enclaves. Rather, in their new agreement, Morocco and Spain will be considering alternative solutions that can serve their respective interests, without Morocco questioning Spain’s legitimacy claims over the two enclaves. 
For official on both sides, the important thing remains that restoring bilateral relations benefit the fight against illegal immigration and the delimitation of the maritime space of both countries off the Atlantic.
Spain’s concession 
Four main reasons stand behind Spain's positive shift on Morocco's Autonomy Plan. Throughout the recent diplomatic crisis, Morocco’s firm resolution succeeded in showing Spain that its territorial integrity is non-negotiable. 
Intractable and inflexible on the fundamentals of its Sahara position, Morocco signaled that it was ready to prolong the diplomatic crisis for as long as necessary until Spain was willing to treat Morocco as an equal partner. 
Enraged by Spain's ""betrayal"" and irreverent lack of reciprocity during the Brahim Ghali episode, Rabat made it clear that there could be no alliance or friendship with Spain so long as Spain continued to: violate the July 1990 cooperation and neighborliness treaty; shirk its historical responsibility in the Sahara conflict; and decline to recognize the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the only viable solution to the Sahara question.
With its back to the wall after months of crisis, Spain started winking at Morocco in an effort to get it to soften its stance. One telling moment of Spain’s growing readiness to defuse tensions was Pedro Sanchez’s reshuffling of his cabinet by notably removing the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Arancha Sanchez Laya. 
And with the appointment of Jose Manuel Albarez as the chief of Spanish diplomacy, Madrid’s discourse on Morocco shifted drastically. Visibly keen to organize a meeting with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita, Albarez spoke repeatedly in favorable, laudatory terms of Spain’s “essential” and “indispensable” cooperation with Morocco. 
But Rabat ignored Madrid’s charm offensive,  suggesting there would be no restoration of “strategic alliance” or “traditional partnership” as long as Spain was not prepared to end its “duplicity” and support Morocco's territorial integrity. 
The second factor in Spain's U-turn is the recent change in Germany's position on the Sahara. Germany's decision to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan caught the Spanish government off guard, especially since Berlin had long been at the forefront of European countries that opposed any agreements between the EU and Morocco that included the Sahara. 
In their coverage of Germany’s decision, several Spanish media outlets said the move showed the Spanish government that if it wanted to re-establish relations with Morocco on a solid basis, it should simply follow the Germans' lead. 
The third factor -- and perhaps the most important -- is Algerian gas. Gas is the cornerstone of the relationship between Spain and Algeria. It was central to the agreements that the Spanish government and its Algerian counterpart brokered between 1972 and 1975 to prevent Morocco from recovering the Sahara. 
In the wake of the July 1972 tripartite summit in Agadir, through which the late King Hassan II sought to establish a common position with Algeria and Mauritania in order to force Spain to cede the Sahara back to Morocco, the then head of Spanish diplomacy, Lopez Bravo, rushed to visit Algiers and Nouakchott to thwart Morocco's strategy.
Bravo and his Algerian counterpart, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, notably signed a trade agreement worth $500 million during the Spanish minister’s visit to Algiers -- under which Spain committed to buying Algerian gas. Algeria has since employed gas to pressure Madrid into taking a position of equidistance between Rabat and Algiers. 
The Algerian game has grown in scale and effectiveness over the years, especially since Algeria has been the leading supplier of natural gas to the Spanish economy for five decades. Until last year, 45 % of Spain's gas needs came from Algeria, a large part of which was supplied through the Europe-Maghreb gas pipeline, whose contract Algeria recently decided to terminate.
That decision to not renew the agreement on the gas pipeline linking Algeria, Spain, and Portugal via Morocco has turned all strategic calculations upside down. Although intended to hurt or “punish” Morocco’s gas market, the Algerian decision has proved to be a geopolitical boon for Rabat. 
Notably, the decision has caused serious damage to the Spanish economy, sending shock waves through the Spanish political establishment. For many in Madrid, the main takeaway has been that Algeria is not a country on which Spain should rely to meet its energy needs. 
Spain has therefore turned to other markets to replace Algerian gas. In particular, the US market has become, for the first time since last February, the primary source of supply for the Spanish market. The US now accounts for 39% of Spain’s gas imports, far ahead of Algeria’s 23% since the closure of the Maghreb pipeline. 
With the Algerian gas set to decline in importance for the Spanish economy, Spain will eventually free itself from Algerian pressure and will be able to manage its relations with Morocco without the usual, Algeria-linked political calculation. That is the reason Madrid decided to endorse Morocco's Autonomy Plan. 
But many in the Spanish have appeared to fear that Algiers would retaliate against Madrid and cut off gas supplies. These reports missed one critical point, however: Gas contracts are long-term deals and no state can unilaterally break them. 
Whatever Algeria chooses to do next following its furious response to Spain’s endorsement of Morocco’s autonomy proposal, the country will have no choice but to honor its gas contract with Spain until 2030. Again, the inter-state regulations governing the gas business are not the same as those of the oil trade. 
Had an oil deal been the primary driver of Spain-Algeria relations, then yes, Algeria would have had the option of suspending its supplies to Spain, since oil contracts are generally short-term. This is an extremely important fact that must be taken into account when analyzing the reasons that led the Sanchez government to position itself in favor of Morocco, regardless of Algeria’s protestations. 
Indeed, Sanchez knows that Algeria, which also needs money, will not be able to terminate the gas contract binding it to Spain. And should Algeria decide to somehow terminate the contract, it would be in blatant violation of the international law that governs such deals. Most significantly, such a move would expose Algiers to the wrath of both Europe and the United States, especially in an international context marked by the war in Ukraine. 
Why would the USA care that much about a gas deal between Algiers and Madrid? An American company, Blackrock, shares 49% of the Medgaz pipeline with Naturgy, Spain’s national gas company; the remaining 51% of the Medgaz deal is held by Algeria’s Sonatrach. 
In addition to these three factors, the war in Ukraine and the geopolitical, political and security upheavals that it is likely to bring about in the short, medium and long terms have also played a role in Spain's shifting of its Western Sahara position in favor of Morocco's autonomy initiative. 
With Europe watching the situation in Ukraine with apprehension, many in Spain fear that a prolongation of the  Russia-Ukraine conflict will lead to unprecedented refugee flows and put the country in an overwhelming migration crisis. 
As it expects a substantial number of refugees fleeing Ukraine, Spain needs to secure its southern border by ensuring the cooperation of its southern neighbor, Morocco. Madrid’s goal and hope, then, is to get Rabat to help stem the flow of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, which has been devastated by the effects of the COVID crisis, notably food insecurity and political instability. 
What about France?
On a broader geostrategic front, Spain's clear support for Morocco's Autonomy Plan is sure to pile up pressure on France. It is true that since Morocco presented its Autonomy Plan to the Security Council in 2007, France has been at the forefront of the countries that have supported it. 
Yet this support has never gone beyond an almost mechanical repetition of the language used in the UN Security Council resolutions -- applauding Morocco's plan and describing it as a ""serious and credible"" basis for resolving the Sahara conflict. 
Even with the US recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over the Sahara having consecrated Morocco’s thesis and made a pro-Morocco shift less risky, France has continued to embrace the Moroccan plan as only ""a serious and credible basis"" to solve the Sahara conflict. But, as I said in a previous analysis, there is, especially in diplomatic language, an abysmal semantic and political difference between the use of a definite and indefinite article. 
In saying that the autonomy plan is “the most serious, credible and realistic” option, Spain is ruling out any other options. This contrasts starkly with France's language, which continues to leave the room open to other alternativer or interpretations. 
Like Spain -- and more than any other Western or European country -- France bears a major responsibility in the origins of the Sahara conflict. Spain would never have occupied the Sahara in the first place without both the Franco-British agreement of April 1904 and the secret agreement that Paris signed with Madrid in October of the same year. 
If Spain had not received military assistance from France and its campaign of ""pacification of Morocco"" (which was in fact a campaign of terror against Moroccan resistance forces) until 1934, it would never have been able to effectively occupy the territory in southern Morocco. 
Faced with the latest developments in the Sahara issue -- the UN and African consensus on the need for compromise and realism, the  US recognition of the Moroccanness of the Sahara, and now the German and Spanish declarations in favor of the Moroccan position -- it is now up to France to make the choice that is so obviously necessary. 
Such a decision will serve not only to repair one of the most cruel injustices that Western colonial conquest has inflicted on Morocco, but it will also and above demonstrate to Morocco and the Moroccan people the sincerity of the French position on the Sahara. 
Moroccan diplomacy, meanwhile, should make sure to implement the central thesis of King Mohammed VI's speech during the 46th anniversary of the Green March: That Morocco will sign no strategic partnership deals with countries that maintain ambiguous or ambivalent, or even subtly hostile positions on Morocco's Western Sahara stance.

166,Western Sahara: Algeria Handed Morocco Spain’s Support on a Silver Platter,"With its blind hatred of Morocco and absence of strategic vision, Algeria handed Spain to Morocco on a silver platter.",Samir Bennis,"Mar. 22, 2022 6:24 p.m.","Washington D.C - With the benefit of hindsight,  it’s now clear that Algeria’s halting of the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline contract, the natural gas pipeline that linked it to Spain and Portugal via  Morocco, was a strategic blunder.
 As it sought to gas-starve Morocco, the Algerian regime ended up fatally murdering all its ambitions to prevent Rabat from making a major breakthrough in its decades-long efforts to get Spain to support its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
 In this sense, Algeria’s cancellation of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline was an unprecedented and valuable gift to Morocco. For one thing, the move has reduced Spain's dependence on Algerian natural gas, given that the gas passing through Morocco accounted for 23 percent of the gas imported from Algeria by Madrid.
The decision has also shown Spanish officials that Algeria is no longer a trustworthy and reliable country in terms of meeting the Spanish market gas needs.
Algeria’s miscalculated gamble
 Algeria’s natural gas accounted for 60 percent of Spain's consumption at the turn of the century and ranged between 50 and 60 percent between 2014 and 2018. 
But due to the short-sightedness of Algeria's generals, Spain's imports of Algerian gas nosedived in recent months, falling from 45 percent in previous months to 23 percent last month. The US supplied 34.6 percent of Spain’s gas needs between January and February this year, supplanting Algeria as the European country’s first gas supplier. 
In September of last year, the US share in Spain’s gas imports was as low as 16 percent. With the surge of US LNG exports to Spain in recent months, it has compensated for the more than 23 percent of Spain’s gas imports through the now-closed Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline.  
 The agility with which Spain has adapted to the considerable decrease in Algerian gas exports to the Spanish market further implies that Madrid has been proactively dealing with this issue for several years now. Spain has pulled through thanks to its world-class liquefied natural gas infrastructure and its long-standing strategy to increase liquefied gas in its import share.
Over the years, Spain has built state-of-the-art infrastructure for the storage and conversion of liquefied gas. Spain is currently the most advanced European country in terms of infrastructure in natural gas storage, boasting six LNG terminals, while a country like Germany has none. Spain alone hosts the third of Europe’s LNG storage capacity.
Such a proactive approach and foresight was instrumental in helping Madrid overcome the devastating effects that the Algerian regime’s reckless decision to terminate the Europe-Maghreb pipeline would have had on the Spanish economy.
Algiers’s decision to stop the gas pipeline was intended to punish and harm Morocco's economy. But little did the Algerian regime suspect that this miscalculated gamble could harm its own strategic interests, especially its relationship with Spain. As of this year, LNG has supplanted natural gas in Spain’s gas market, representing 70 percent of its total imports. Just a year ago, LNG represented less than 50 percent of Spain’s gas imports.

Given its advanced infrastructure in terms of natural gas storage, Madrid will gradually be able to reduce Algeria's impact on its economy and weaken the gas card that the Algerian regime has been playing for five decades to pressure Spain and dissuade it from supporting the Moroccanness of Western Sahara.
Algeria was painfully reminded of this sober reality when, on Friday last week, Spain announced a historic shift regarding its position on Western Sahara.
In affirming, for the first time, its clear and straightforward support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, Madrid put an end to the sitting-on-the-fence or equidistance policy with which it had approached the Sahara question for much of the past five decades to preserve its interests.
But more than the shattering of Madrid’s long-standing equidistance policy, Spain’s newfound support for Morocco’s Western Sahara stance means Algeria has lost the gas leverage it used to have on the Spanish political elite. The timing of Wendy Sherman, US Deputy Secretary of State to Spain, Morocco, and Algeria earlier this month, and just less than weeks before Spain announced its endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan suggest that there was coordination between Rabat, Madrid, and Washington. 
As some reports have indicated, this curious coincidence suggests that Spain may have received guarantees from the US administration that it will intensify its gas supplies to the Spanish economy and eventually help the European country wean itself off Algeria’s gas. 
Spain knows that apart from the gas deal its partnership with Algeria is almost non-existent. Furthermore, Spain is fully aware that the bilateral trade balance has always been in Algeria's favor.
By comparison, the European country has dense and multiple interests in and with Morocco, be it in terms of economic and commercial cooperation or the security and shared destiny by virtue of geographical proximity.
On the economic front, for instance, more than 1,000 Spanish companies are currently operating in Morocco. As well, Spain has become Morocco's first economic partner with a favorable trade surplus that impacts its economy positively. 
Algeria cannot retaliate
Contrary to what is being claimed in some Spanish media and political circles, Algeria will not be able to take any punitive decision against Spain.
And anyone who thinks Algeria can still halt gas flowing to Spain has, to put it rather politely, a wrong and misguided reading of the situation. Unlike oil-related contracts that are often short-term deals, gas contracts are long-term agreements that extend for multiple years if not decades.
Hence, Algeria is bound to honor the deal it signed with Spain in 2018 on the Medgaz pipeline connecting the Algerian city of Beni Saf to the Spanish city of Almeria. The agreement is valid until 2030, meaning Algeria will not -- or cannot, more precisely -- halt its gas exports to Spain.
Even more critical, Algeria will not be able to review the deal’s financial terms and mold them with the current rise in gas prices.
But should the Algerian regime somehow muster the temerity of terminating its gas deal with Spain in retaliation for the country’s pro-Moroccan stance on Western Sahara, it would be in blatant violation of the regulations that govern such contracts between states.
In such a highly unlikely scenario, Algiers would also be under pressure from the European Union and the United States, which has been working painstakingly for months to reduce the EU's dependence on Russian gas.
The Medgaz pipeline is 51 % owned by Algeria's Sonatrach, while the Spanish company Naturgy and the American company Blackrock share the remaining 49 %. Thus, if Algeria takes any retaliatory step against Spain, it would put itself in direct confrontation with the US.
In short, with its regime’s lack of strategic vision coupled with the blind hatred of Morocco, Algeria handed Spain to Morocco on a silver platter. In seeking to “punish” Rabat, Algiers ended up unwittingly fulfilling Morocco’s long-running goal of securing Madrid’s unequivocal embrace of the Moroccan position on Western Sahara.
More important than US’ recognition
Spain's declaration of support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is psychologically and symbolically more meaningful than the United States’ recognition of the Moroccanness of Western Sahara, which has become US official policy. 
With Spain having substantial political and cultural influence in Latin American countries, its newly-adopted position on the Sahara will undoubtedly affect that of many other countries in Latin America. So, the Spanish move might prove to be additional good news for Morocco given the country's recent investments in buttressing its diplomatic outreach in Latin America.
 But an even more pertinent reason is Spain’s historical association with, and responsibility in, the Western Sahara dispute. As the former colonial power of Morocco’s southern provinces, Spain’s epochal change of its long-held position of “positive neutrality” on the dispute is undoubtedly more shocking to, and unbearable for, the Algerian regime than the US’ endorsement of Morocco.
Since the end of 1960s, Madrid and Algeria have stood against Morocco’s territorial integrity and regularly colluded to thwart the country’s efforts to reunite with its southern provinces.
As such, Algeria’s furious response to Spain’s endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan speaks of the unparalleled pain and agony of losing leverage over, and the support of, a long-time accomplice.
For Morocco, meanwhile, Madrid’s historic change of heart is a potent vindication of the increasing preeminence of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the best way out of the decades-long diplomatic gridlock in Western Sahara. 
 And so, that Morocco was eventually able to dismantle the Algiers-Madrid pact, which had long worked in secret to oppose Morocco’s interests, is a testament to the growing effectiveness of Moroccan diplomacy.

167,Western Sahara: The Significance of 2022 US Consolidated Appropriations Bill for Morocco,The 2022 US Appropriations Bill has created a momentous precedent for the long-running pro-Morocco momentum on the Sahara question.,Samir Bennis,"Mar. 18, 2022 4:11 p.m.","Washington - For pro-Polisario commentators and lobbyists still hoping that the Biden administration will at some point repudiate the US’ pro-Morocco policy on the Western Sahara dispute, the US Consolidated Appropriations Bill signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 15 is the latest indication that the recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara is now official US policy.  
Ever since President Joe Biden came to office, Algerian-paid Lobbyists and many pro-Polisario pundits have been hoping to see the new administration reverse its predecessor’s recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara. In fact, many of the most vociferous pro-Polisario voices in the US were quick to dismiss former President Donald Trump’s support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. 
As they saw it, Trump’s siding with Morocco in its decade-long diplomatic fight against Algerian-backed separatism was at best a unilateral and pointless move, and at worst a reckless and unconscionable violation of international law and traditional US foreign policy.
Driven by the self-righteous fury that has become the marker of pro-Polisario advocacy, some of them called on the Biden administration to disavow the December 10 proclamation to restore what they described as US neutrality. In their truncated and self-serving telling of the Western Sahara story -- and history -- they brazenly argued that the now disqualified referendum of self-determination remains the general international consensus on how to end the Sahara conflict.  
By shrewdly and misleadingly invoking separatist talking points like “self-determination,” “oppression,” and “occupation,” they hoped to galvanize the new American administration into embracing what they presented as the US’ commitment to the downtrodden and wretched of the world. As anyone familiar with Polisario’s shock strategy would know, this was victimology at its best.
Judging from Biden’s lukewarm but non-insignificant embrace of his predecessor’s Western Sahara policy, and the US Congress’ increasingly clear support for Morocco, however, it is safe to say that the past two years have been a clear dismissal of Algerian-paid lobbyists’ pro-Polisario propaganda.      
Language Matters
To be sure, the Biden administration’s Western Sahara juggling act is not exactly the ringing support that many in Rabat expected. Yet, the Appropriations Bill has provided further cogent evidence that calculated hesitation and temporary diplomatic sensitivity should not be confused with utter repudiation or unmistakable rejection.
For one thing, the document has shown that, rather than the product of a whimsical president, the US’ embrace of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the best way out of the Sahara conflict was the culmination of decades-long US support for Morocco’s efforts to preserve its territorial integrity. 
To put things into perspective: The “Morocco” subheading of the new bill reads that “Funds appropriated under titles III and IV of this Act shall be made available for assistance for Morocco.” It is thus the first US bill to refer to Morocco without any mention of “Western Sahara.” And because language carries an important weight in political documents, the main takeaway from the “Morocco” section of this new US spending bill is that the US administration now views “Western Sahara” as unambiguously Moroccan.
In all previous US bills relating to US assistance to Morocco, US lawmakers made sure to systematically imply that because the final status of Western Sahara was still “pending,” it was not to be considered under Morocco’s sovereignty.
And so, even as most US appropriations put no major hurdles in Morocco’s way to use the funds allocated to it in Western Sahara, there was always a thin nuance by means of which US lawmakers sought to ensure that the allocation of these funds to Western Sahara was not tantamount to explicitly recognizing Morocco’s full sovereignty over the territory. 
For example, all US Appropriation Bills adopted between 2014 and 2021 made funds allocated to Morocco available for use in Western Sahara. But the use of these funds was subject to certain restrictions and was contingent on the Department of State notifying congress within three months of the appropriation bill and after consulting with the Appropriations Committee on the use of such funds in Western Sahara. 
For all Congress’ nuance and caution when it came to endorsing the use of those funds in “Western Sahara,” Morocco viewed US lawmakers’ guarded permission as tacit support for its sovereignty over the region. 
Algeria’S Short-Lived Victories
But slightly complicating the story for Morocco is that Algeria was keen to take advantage of Congress’ hesitations. The country recruited a lobbying firm, Foley Hoag, to lobby certain influential members of Congress to sabotage Morocco's efforts to resolve the dispute. The Senate was Algerian lobbyist’s most preferred turf for much of the past two decades. Foley Hoag relied on the sympathy of two extremely influential senators -- James Inhofe and Patrick Leahy -- to relay Algeria’s concerns to the other members of the Senate, they short-lived. 
In 2018, for example, Inhofe and Leahy succeeded in persuading the Senate to adopt an appropriations bill that decoupled Morocco from Western Sahara. This version of the bill did not, however, make it to the final version adopted in the House. As a result, the consolidated bill adopted by both chambers of Congress -- and later on signed into law by the Trump administration -- included Morocco and its Western Sahara region under the same subheading. 
Long before the 2022 Appropriation Bill’s decidedly pro-Morocco language, the Biden’s administration had given many signs of its commitment to Morocco’s Western Sahara position. 
Morocco’S Momentum
The most important such signals were the adoption by the US State Department and other US government-affiliated institutions of undivided maps of Morocco, and the inclusion of Western Sahara in the “Morocco” section of the State Department’s latest country report on Human right and religious freedoms. As such, the past months have made it increasingly clear that Algeria and its lobbyist’s pro-Polisario propaganda will continue to fall on deaf ears given the US’ commitment to upholding its Western Sahara policy.      
The deafening silence of Algerian media following President Biden’s signing of the 2022 Appropriations Bill this week speaks volumes. Frustrated and dismayed, Algeria is now realizing that the novelty of the new bill in comparison to the previous ones is that it contains absolutely no ambiguity as to US support for Morocco’s territorial integrity. 
The fact that the US bill completely omits the term “Western Sahara” and refers instead to Morocco as a single, indivisible territory is a huge diplomatic setback for Algeria and signals the dwindling credibility and effectiveness of its lobbying efforts in Washington. By underlining US support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the only legitimate basis of any solution to the decades-long conflict, the text of the 2022 Appropriation Bill shows the progress Morocco has made over the past 15 years to secure support for its territorial integrity despite Algerian attempts to undermine its efforts in Washington.           
The 2008 Appropriation bill did not, for instance, make funds allocated to Morocco available for use in Western Sahara. Rather, it provided $3.65 million of military assistance to Morocco, and made an additional $1 million available for use in Western Sahara.
Most importantly, the use of the funds allocated to “Western Sahara” was contingent on Morocco making “progress on human rights.” If the Moroccan wished to use US funds in Western Sahara, the bill stressed, it had to allow “all persons to advocate freely their views regarding the status and future of the Western Sahara through the exercise of their rights to peaceful expression, association and assembly.” 
Four years later, the 2012 Appropriations bill placed the same restrictions on the use of funds allocated to Morocco. As well as making a distinction between Morocco and Western Sahara, the bill involved the same “human rights progress” conditions as in 2008. By contrast, the 2022 Appropriations Bill has created a momentous precedent for the long-running pro-Morocco momentum on the Sahara question.
By omitting the term “Western Sahara” and referring to Morocco as a single nation, the 2022 US Appropriations Bill signals a new era in US foreign policy and provides Congress with the legal clarity it needs to act confidently and decisively in support of Moroccan territorial integrity, however hard Algeria tries to lobby against it.
But because the Algerian establishment sees Western Sahara as the epitome of its zero-sum competition against Morocco for hegemony over the Maghreb, the latest, pro-Moroccan developments are sure to push Algeria to redouble its lobbying efforts to undo the diplomatic progress Morocco has achieved in Washington in recent years.      
However, given the current pro-Rabat sentiment in Washington, and the announced retirement of Senators Leahy and Inhofe, anyone betting on Algeria’s ability to sway the Washington political establishment in its favor on the Sahara question will be betting on a losing horse. 
And yet, as I have argued elsewhere, however, this new era of unprecedented pro-Morocco momentum should not be an excuse for Moroccan officials to grow complacent and rest on their laurels.

168,"Morocco repels 1,000 migrants trying to reach Spain",The 2022 US Appropriations Bill has created a momentous precedent for the long-running pro-Morocco momentum on the Sahara question.,Afp,"Nov. 20, 2013 2:15 p.m.","MADRID: Moroccan security forces drove back a crowd of about 1,000 migrants who charged at the border fence trying to climb into Spain's north African territory of Melilla, Spanish authorities said on Wednesday.
""A very large group of about a thousand sub-Saharan immigrants"" rushed to the fence and were ""held back and dispersed by the Moroccan forces"" overnight on Tuesday to Wednesday, the Spanish government delegation in Melilla said in a statement.
A video captured by night-vision security cameras and released by the Spanish Civil Guard showed the migrants in a long line moving towards the fence from the nearby hills where they were camped.
Driven back from the fence, the crowd headed towards a nearby border crossing but then retreated without trying to cross again, the government said.
Authorities say thousands of migrants have tried to reach Spain from Morocco this year by scrambling over the six-metre (19-foot) border fences or crossing the Mediterranean in flimsy vessels.
Several have died in the attempt but hundreds have made it across and ended up in overcrowded immigrant processing centres.
Melilla and Ceuta, another Spanish territory bordering northern Morocco, form the European Union's only land borders with Africa. Each of the two towns has a population of about 80,000.
In a bid to ward off the migrants, Spain this month began putting barbed wire and ""anti-climbing"" mesh at points along Melilla's 11-kilometre (seven-mile) border, drawing complaints from human rights groups.
About 3,000 migrants tried to scale the border fence around Melilla between January 1 and September 17, compared to 1,610 during the same period last year, Spain's interior ministry says.
The Syrian civil war, conflicts in Mali and the unrest sparked in North African and Middle Eastern countries by the Arab Spring have added to migratory pressures on Spain, it says.
""This latest foiled attempt shows yet again the extreme migratory pressure on this town and the necessity to reinforce anti-intrusion measures,"" said Wednesday's government statement from Melilla.
Human rights groups say the migrants are brought to Morocco from other African countries by traffickers and camp in the wild while waiting for a chance to cross.

170,5 Psychological Benefits of Fasting During Ramadan,"Various studies have confirmed that fasting has significant benefits for a person's mental health, as it improves stamina, self-control, and mood.",Mariya Sahnouni,"Apr. 10, 2022 4:51 p.m.","As the fourth pillar of Islam, fasting is an absolute necessity for observing Muslims. However, fasting is not about only abstaining from food, drinks, and pleasure. 
It is not merely a physical act, and while there are health benefits to fasting, it has spiritual and psychological benefits too. Ramadan is a paramount 30-day spiritual journey that enhances our self-control and strengthens our patience.
Fasting strengthens self-control and willpower
Fasting increases the person's ability to control their cravings and desires. Refraining from foods, beverages, or certain pleasures allows for a higher level of self-control. This ability makes the person more apt to walk through life with a strong will by not allowing anything to pull them towards what they do not want.
Fasting trains the person and strengthens his ability to control himself. It subordinates all worldly inclinations under the control of the will. This is manifested in the abandonment of certain bad habits, such as smoking. You cleanse your body and mind, and you gain behavioral control. 
Self-control feels empowering, and it enables the person to be more self-disciplined, reflect on themselves and gain mental clarity. It also makes the process of breaking bad habits easier. 
Research indicates that people low in self-control are less happy than those with high self-control. Self-control is positively related to happiness and life satisfaction. It facilitates momentary happiness by helping people behave in ways that reduce mental conflict and thus prevent emotional distress.
Cultivating patience - Ramadan as the month of patience
Fasting means being patient in the face of hunger and thirst. It is very tough going, especially for those unaccustomed to it and people who work or study during long days and intense heat. 
Besides abstaining from food and beverages, you cannot engage in any sexual activity, swear, gossip, argue, fight, be disrespectful, or even respond to someone who insults you. All of which require a high level of patience and tolerance.
Being patient will not go unrewarded, however. According to research, patient people experience less depression and negative emotions. They are mindful and feel a sense of gratitude and connection to humanity and the universe.
Peacefulness and mental clarity
Ramadan allows us to take a break from the stress of life, as it is a time of tranquility and peace. The holy month enables us to focus on our spiritual relationship with God. We are committed to worship, solitary contemplation, and reflecting on what we may not consider in light of our daily concerns.
It also promotes values of tolerance, generosity, giving, good deeds, love, contentment, and reconciliation with oneself.
Spiritual fulfillment
Psychological well-being and tranquility are associated with the spiritual aspect of fasting. Spiritual fulfillment is achieved by reading the Quran and getting closer to God, which leads to a healthy psychological state, inner peace, and stability. It also reduces depression and anxiety.
According to research, spiritual people have positive relationships, high self-esteem, are optimistic, and have meaning and purpose in life.
Improved relationships and sense of belonging
Ramadan strengthens relationships as it involves the exchange of family visits, even with those with whom you have cut off ties because it is a month of forgiveness. During the holy month, individuals revive relationships and strengthen the bonds of family ties.

While all these elements may sound overwhelming, the key to achieving these benefits is simple. Whatever psychological state a person is in, they need only to consciously practice these tips as best they can and that will be a mark of improvement.

171,Israel Aims to Replace Palestinian Construction Workers with Moroccans,"Israel wants Moroccan construction workers to replace its largely Palestinian construction workforce, in an attempt to undermine Palestinian workers in Israel.",Lamine Rahhali,"Apr. 08, 2022 4:15 p.m.","Rabat - Israel is making plans to replace thousands of its construction workers of different nationalities, mostly Palestinian, with Moroccan workers.
First reported by Moroccan news outlet 24Kech, which cites a source in Tel Aviv, the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers (IFBWW) in Israel is negotiating with various official authorities in Morocco.
Undermining Palestinians?
According to a 2019 report from UNCTAD, “Over 127,000 of Palestinian workers (24% of the West Bank employed workforce) are employed in Israel and settlements.”
The majority of Palestinians work in Israel's construction sector, where they are estimated to make up 65-70 percent of the total workforce.
The report indicates that the Palestinian labor market's reliance on Israel has been facilitated by a scarcity of low-skilled labor in Israel, particularly in agriculture and construction.
Attempts to fill the labor shortage with workers from Asia were initially unsuccessful because Palestinians return to the West Bank at the end of the workday; therefore, they won’t have a significant effect on Israel’s demographic structure, adds the report.
Questionable labor conditions
Among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Israel has one of the highest death rates among construction workers, reported the Business & Human Rights Resource Center in 2020.
Palestinian workers in the Israeli construction sector get their salaries deducted for “social benefits.” However, they receive none of these benefits that they are entitled to.
Labor-oriented Israeli NGO Kav LaOved has reported on the systematic violations of Palestinian workers' rights. Its April 2021 report reveals that ""34% of Palestinian construction workers still have to pay for Israeli permits; 84.7% have asked their employer for sick pay but only 7.8% have received it; 74.6% were not informed that they should have a pension fund; most workers do not receive a payslip on a regular basis as required by law; and authorities do not enforce workers’ rights.""
Israeli plan 
Despite the importance of construction work to Palestinians, and the dangerous nature of Israel’s construction sector, Israel now appears to aim to attract Moroccans to replace Palestinian workers.

The newspaper said that if the Israeli federation manages to reach a mutual agreement with Morocco, then thousands of Moroccan construction workers will be asked to replace the current construction workers in Israel.
Negotiations are expected to see a breakthrough in the coming weeks, especially following further rapprochement between Morocco and Israel that resulted from the Negev summit at the end of last March.
The Israeli IFBWW is interested in plasterers, particularly those who specialize in plaster engraving. The Federation hopes to attract Moroccan professionals with monthly salaries ranging from MAD 20,000 ($2056) to MAD 30,000 ($3084), free housing, and transportation from and to their workstations.
Moroccan-Israeli Relations
Following the resumption of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel in 2020 as a result of the Abraham Accord, companies on both sides expressed interest in establishing joint ventures between the two countries.
The two countries have also collaborated economically and culturally. On March 20, the Moroccan Society for Tourism Engineers (SMIT) hosted a webinar with Israeli investors, and relations between Israeli and Moroccan economic and cultural actors have grown significantly in the last year.
Morocco, Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt attended the Negev Summit on March 27, in which Israel promised to share some of its advanced technical defense systems with the participating countries.

She is a scientific researcher, COVID-19 policy and political advisor and works as a freelance advisor under her company name Zemouri Public Health Research & Consultancy.
Amsterdam - Each year, on the 9th month of the Islamic Calendar, hundreds of millions of Muslims around the globe fast. As a special for Morocco World News, I present a number of health benefits of  fasting during Ramadan and some tips to  enjoy  a safe and healthy holy month..
Intermittent fasting versus Ramadan fasting
Intermittent fasting has gained worldwide recognition and is well   recognised for its health benefits. Did you know that Ramadan fasting is a form of intermittent fasting? The only difference is that during Islamic fasting one abstains as well from drinking fluids. 
Energy transition
In the morning, after completing suhur, your body uses mainly carbohydrates as its energy source from the food eaten. As the day continues, your body shifts from burning carbs to burning the stored fat in your body. Ramadan fasting works well for losing weight. However, one must maintain a healthy diet during the nights, and ensure plenty of physical exercise.
Calorie restriction
Humans have been consuming more calories as we progress in wealth and technology than ever before. Thanks to Ramadan fasting, one reduces the consumption of calories giving the body the chance to detox, learn how to control blood sugar levels, and prevent weight gain. You eventually learn how your body can still function perfectly with less calorie intake. Bare in mind that this can only be achieved if you maintain a healthy diet.
Less inflammation
People with inflammatory diseases such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis have a higher level of inflammatory markers in their body. These markers (such as cytokines) are associated with disease. When fasting, the body reduces the number of these proinflammatory markers resulting in less risk of disease.
Sugar control
Insulin is a hormone in the body that transforms sugars into energy for your body and controls the level of sugar. A healthy body has a high insulin sensitivity, while people with diabetes have low insulin sensitivity. Fasting improves insulin sensitivity and sugar control. You could say that fasting is a great way of calibrating your insulin levels. For those who are diagnosed with a metabolic disease, please consult your doctor for tailored advice on fasting.
Better teeth
Each time a person eats, the acids and sugars from the food impact the tooth enamel. The more time spent eating, the higher the risk of tooth decay. When fasting, your teeth get a rest from all the acidic attacks. Also, did you know that the frequent rinsing of the mouth during ablution helps to prevent mouth dryness? So rinse well!
Mental health
Some families and friends may struggle to find enough time and opportunities to get together for dinner and prayer. During Ramadan, it is an Islamic tradition to break fast together and get that quality time. Those who are isolated can get out of their house and come together. The many public iftars organized in communities help people connect, make new friends and find joy in sharing food and prayer. The gathering for iftar and prayer is an especially nice occasion for Muslim migrants and converted persons who have little to no relatives to share the precious Ramadan times with. Do look out for each other.
Reflection
I asked dr. Iman Tohami, doctor of Clinical Psychology (known from Instagram @Saidintherapy), what she considers to be the most important aspect of Ramadan with regards to mental health. She shared the following with Morocco World News: 
“Ramadan gives us the chance to reflect on our habits. It can give us the ability to avoid unhealthy behaviors for an entire month and can be a starting point towards starting over and building up resistance to triggers, while also addressing our urges and impulses in a healthy manner.”
Getting rid of your bad habits
In the Western world there is a tradition to use New Year’s Eve as a moment to set good intentions like cessation of smoking or drinking alcohol. Ever heard of Dry January? A challenge for people to abstain from alcohol. Muslims have a tradition that is over 1,400 years old that takes place during Ramadan. Ramadan offers a 29/30 day challenge. It is the perfect month to quit smoking and abstain from alcohol or any other toxins. Who knows, maybe this Ramadan can be your perfect chance to start a new healthy and mindful lifestyle. For myself, I decided to make best use of this Ramadan to become less caffeine dependent.
Safe mosque practices
In many countries, it is allowed to pray taraweeh in large gatherings in the mosque. The COVID-19 pandemic might not be as severe as it was before, mostly thanks to increased immunity, but many elderlies and people with underlying diseases are still at risk of severe corona infection. Since many of our elderly wish to attend the mosque for prayer, one can take precautions of ensuring a safe mosque practice. Here are some tips:
    • Take your own prayer rug
    • Perform the ablution at home
    • Wear a mask in the mosque
    • Make sure the mosque is well ventilated
    • Stay at home when sick or if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection
    • Get yourself tested if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection or have been in contact with a COVID-19 case.
Food coma
You know that feeling when you overeat and you need to lay down for a moment? That is the ‘after iftar food coma’. It happens when you eat too much at the iftar table, especially food with a lot of sugar, fats and calories. At that moment the blood in your body goes to your stomach. No more energy and blood are left for your brain or your body to get up and continue your evening.
Oral hygiene
Do not forget to maintain your oral hygiene. Even when fasting all day, your mouth still needs proper care. It is important to keep on brushing your teeth with fluoride-based toothpaste, floss your teeth, and to also brush your tongue. Yes, your tongue! That is where most bacteria stick to and cause those odors. Do not rinse your mouth with alcohol containing mouth rinses. The alcohol compound dries out the mouth and increases the risk of oral health problems. Also, for those who like to use miswak, keep on doing it! Evidence shows that miswak is a good way to keep your teeth healthy and well. However, modern day toothbrushes, interdental sticks and floss make your oral hygiene easier.
Keep up the good work
Maintain all the good new habits of Ramadan once Ramadan is over. Stay off all the excessive sweets, fats, drinks and cigarettes. Be nice to your body. Eat mindfully.
Ramadan Kareem!

174,Why Muslims Fast During Ramadan,"For Muslims, Ramadan is a holy month of fasting, introspection, and prayer.",Lamine Rahhali,"Apr. 01, 2022 8:03 p.m.","Rabat - During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset every day. They are also expected to refrain from impure thoughts and bad behavior.
Ramadan is commemorated as the month in which Muhammad received the first revelations of the Quran, Muslims' holy book.
Ramadan is the ninth month of the lunar based 12-month Islamic calendar.
What is Islam
Along with Judaism and Christianity, Islam is regarded as one of the three major Abrahamic religions. Muslims are adherents of Islam, who ""submit"" to God's will. Islam is a universal religion that teaches that God is merciful and compassionate. 
With approximately 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide, Islam is the world's second-largest religion after Christianity. Although its origins date back further, scholars generally date Islam's birth to the 7th century, making it the youngest of the major world religions.
The spread of Islam began in Mecca, modern-day Saudi Arabia, during the prophet Muhammad's lifetime. 
Muslims adhere to five fundamental pillars that are central to their faith: Shahada, Salat, Zakat, Sawm, and Hajj.
The Shahada is to declare one’s faith in God and belief in Muhammad. 
The Salat are prayers that Muslims perform five times a day ( dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening).
The Zakat is to give a portion of your yearly income to those in need. 
The Sawm entails fasting in Ramadan. 
The Hajj means performing a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, at least once during a person’s lifetime, if the person is able to.
Fasting in Ramadan
The Britannica Encyclopedia defines fasting as “abstinence from food or drink or both for health, ritualistic, religious, or ethical purposes”. Fasting in Ramadan lasts from dawn until sunset, and it means abstaining from all food and drink 
Muslims are advised to eat a pre-fast meal known as Suhur before sunrise. This meal is similar to breakfast in a lot of places, but in some cultures, it may include more dinner-like foods.
After sunset, Muslims break their fast with iftar, a meal that typically begins with dates and water or milk, and ends with dinner.
Muslims are allowed to snack between those two meals at night, and hydration is encouraged, especially when Ramadan occurs during the summer.

Why do Muslims fast?
Muslims fast as a form of worship, as an opportunity to grow closer to God, and a way to become more compassionate to those in need.
Fasting is also thought to be a good way to learn patience and break bad habits.
“Alongside Humans, Animals fast as well. Scientists noticed that certain animal species go through an optional fasting phase, even though food is around,” the president of the Ulema Council in Berrchid Dr. Abdelmoghith Bassir, said in an interview with Morocco World News.
He elaborates by saying that “some birds stay in their nest and abstain from food in certain seasons, while certain fish species bury themselves in the bottom of the ocean or rivers for a period of time without eating.” 
When asked about the benefits of fasting, Bassir noted that it “has great benefits, both spiritually and physically… It helps humans resist temptation and the struggles that they might undergo. It also teaches patience, endurance, and altruism.” 
Fasting in Ramadan also unites Muslims, because everyone who is a member of the faith in the world is going through the same experience. 
It develops compassion. When Muslims feel hungry during fasting, it makes them remember all the unfortunate people who have nothing to eat or drink.
Fasting can also be a viable medical treatment, Dr Phillips used to recommend fasting to his patients because it functions like a detox process. For a patient to benefit fully from medical fasting, they need to perform it under the guidance of a medical expert, in order to avoid unwanted side effects.
Dr. Bassir concluded the interview by saying “that anyone who wants to fast should follow a balanced diet,” and doesn’t recommend eating too much during Suhur and Iftar in order to fully benefit from fasting in Ramadan.

In addition to the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) certified courses, and in partnership with Lancaster University and Templar Executives, a cyber security MBA developed in the UK will be offered, a prestigious program created by experts from Lancaster University’s School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University Management School, and Templar Executives.
The new Center, which is expected to open in September 2024 in Marrakech, will be able to accommodate up to 1000 students.
What is Templar Executives?
Templar Executives is a global cyber security and information assurance firm, a British Crown commercial service supplier, and a consultant to governments, multinational corporations, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It offers a world-class portfolio of specialist, industry-specific cyber security solutions and services designed to demystify the cyberthreat landscape and give a business-enabling capacity for building and enhancing organizational cyber resilience.
Cybersecurity in Morocco 
Morocco is becoming increasingly reliant on digital infrastructure, therefore technology becomes a potential weakness in security. The confidentiality and integrity of ICT infrastructure are under attack from fast-expanding cyber threats such as cyber fraud, theft of intellectual property and personally identifiable information, service interruption, property damage or destruction, and espionage.
One of Morocco’s current priorities is to promote the use of digital technology while continuing to protect human rights by combating cybercrime. 
In 2020, Morocco ranked 50th out of 182 nations in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) cybersecurity report, and seventh in the Arab world, behind Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Egypt, Qatar, and Tunisia, in first to sixth places respectively.
In order to increase confidence and stimulate the digital economy, Morocco has developed legal regulations for cybercrime protection.
On June 28, 2021, King Mohammed VI approved a draft cybersecurity law. This new law aims to create a legal framework that allows for the strengthening of information system security in state administrations and territorial authorities. The law also provides contractual structures for public institutions and individual persons or organizations, in particular telecommunications companies. It also establishes robust security safeguards for critical infrastructure.
UK-Morocco Collaboration
Since 2018, Morocco and the United Kingdom have committed to work constructively together to build a new international agreement on cybercrime that is comprehensive, results-oriented, and allows for the protection of human rights.
Morocco is the first country with which the UK and its partners, including the International Telecommunication Union and Oxford University, have created such a connection.
As a result of this collaboration between British and Moroccan enterprises and institutions,   the two countries announced the establishment of a ‘Cyber Security Centre of Excellence for Africa’ in Morocco.
The center’s plans underscore Morocco’s position as an African pioneer in cybersecurity, bolstering the country’s strong presence in the digital world and reputation as the most connected country in Africa, with a rapidly rising internet penetration rate of over 74%. 
“Morocco’s position as an African leader in addressing climate change makes what happens here absolutely vital to the way the green energy transition proceeds across the entire African continent,” said  Simon Martin, the British Ambassador for Morocco. “That’s why I’m so keen and so pleased to see the way in which we have this interaction between British and Moroccan businesses, as well as our academics from universities in both countries working together in this way,” he said as he introduced the highly topical workshop.

176,Diversity Sets the Table for American Muslims Observing Ramadan,There is no one way to spend Ramadan in the US.,Brooke Benoit,"Mar. 31, 2022 8:19 p.m.","Agadir - The immense diversity of people in the US is reflected in the diverse ways American Muslims spend the holy month. Currently, nearly 3.5 million Muslims of all ages live in the US and about 80% of adults fast during Ramadan. 
Like many Muslims worldwide, while daily prayers are not strictly adhered to by 39-44% of American Muslims, Ramadan is an essential pillar that four out of five observe. This number does not take into account those who cannot pray for various health reasons. 
According to the Pew Research Center, 82% of Muslim women and 77% of men fast in the US.  The Pew survey addressed participants' religiosity. Of the surveyed fasting Muslims, 92% said religion is “very important” in their lives and 65% said religion is “somewhat important,” fasted at 65%. But, the surveyors were surprised to find that “even among American Muslims who say religion is ‘not too’ or ‘not at all’ important, a substantial share (41%) say they fast.” 
Business as usual
As a marginalized group and religion, Ramadan is not recognized as a holiday across the states, which means it is life as usual at work and school during their holy month for most Muslims. Unlike in Morocco, US Muslims face people eating in front of them all day at work, school, and outside their homes.
Many non-Muslims are shocked to learn about fasting and believe it could be dangerous. American Muslims have numerous memes reflecting the question they are frequently asked about fasting, “Not even water?!” 
Discrimination is an all too common issue for American Muslims. While only 1% of the US population is Muslim, they account for 2% of the overall workforce, yet they account for 25% of workplace discrimination complaints.
Muslims fasting at work have enough challenges; being told they cannot pray based on the inconvenience of aligning prayer times with work breaks is illegal, yet it still happens.
Community affairs
Great food and great vibes can help ease the troubles American Muslims may have at work. The majority of American Muslims say that mosques are not central to their spirituality. But during the holy month, mosques and Muslim community centers in the US come alive with activity. 
Mahera Islam told Healthline about the feelings of inclusion she experienced by attending the mosque during Ramadan. She said, “You still feel like an outsider many days…. You still feel like your culture, or your ‘lifestyle as a Muslim,’ is somehow not in line with… North American culture,” she says. “Seeing people every day during Ramadan practicing and being unapologetically Muslim brings up your mood, and it makes you feel happy.”
Communities regularly break their fasts together at iftar meals held in mosques every night during Ramadan. These affairs are even bigger and better on the weekends when working Muslims can put more effort into cooking and attending.
Before the Mahgreb prayer, buffet tables are set up in the mosque. Depending on the mosque’s layout, sometimes they are just to the side of the prayer area, in a separate room, or in two areas; one for women and one for men.
After praying, the congregation breaks their fast with an amazing array of dishes. Some mosques cater to specific communities, such as Black American Muslims, Pakistanis, Arabs, regional Africans, and so on. Such mosques will usually have dishes that mostly reflect those cultures.
Mosques with diverse congregations will have international-style buffets that can include dishes such as samosas, pizza, biryani, curry, macaroni and cheese, enchiladas, semolina cakes, and so on. There are even vegetarian and vegan iftars in some communities. Leftovers at mosque iftars are plated up for people to take home and have for suhoor.
Wastefulness has been a problem for US iftars and many Muslims are now encouraging ‘Green Iftars’ with a focus on reducing disposable service ware and not wasting food.
After breaking the fast at the mosque, people make dhikr and dua, read the Quran, and socialize. Young people and children thoroughly enjoy the unique opportunity to cut loose with their friends on school nights.
Sahla Denton of Oregon fondly recalled her childhood Ramadans to US media outlet Vox, “One of my favorite Ramadan memories was when I was little and we used to go to the mosque for iftar. It would be me and my friend, and we’d have to help the little kids serve their food, and so I remember going back and forth to the food line so many times, but it was a lot of fun.”
Scheduled lectures and classes on the weekends accompany the nightly tarawih prayers throughout the month. In larger communities, these events can be the highlight of the year with guest speakers flying in from across the globe.
The most charitable month  
Another highlight of the year occurring in Ramadan is giving charity and fundraising, which Muslims universally believe will give them increased blessings for doing so during the holy month. 
Before the pandemic, Islamic Relief USA raised $2 million during Ramadan in its northeast region alone. This accounts for nearly half of what the organization received in the region during the entire year. That is the result of just one organization in one region of the US.
In 2020, Muslim groups shifted some of their Ramadan charity work to focus on those suffering from pandemic-induced hardships. The New Jersey record reported on organizations working at “helping families who are dealing with coronavirus, including health issues and loss of income.”
Among them, “SMILE, along with FaithNYC, The Muslim Network, and the Islamic Center for Passaic County, formed a coalition last month to buy, package and deliver groceries during the pandemic. Even after expanding, the groups are struggling to keep up with the demand spurred by the economic shutdown.” The website added that as the group delivered 500 packages per week, “Another 500 families are still on a waitlist for aid.”
A tinge of sadness
While some Muslims are able to throw themselves into charity work during the holy month, many American Muslims face degrees of depression. For those who have emigrated to America, there is sadness and longing for the normalcy of the Ramadans they experience back home with their extended families.
Some fortunate Muslims in the US are able to visit ‘back home’ during Ramadan. Even fewer have the extra-fortunate opportunity to spend the 10 nights of Laylat al-Qadr Night making umrah.
For Muslim converts, Ramadan presents many challenges. After years and cherished memories of celebrating other holidays, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, adjusting to Ramadan can be difficult. 
Fasting is hard for many converts to practice as grown adults who never had the opportunity to playfully practice fasting partial days as children. They also often do not have the support of other fasting people around them. 
Imagine waking in the dark to prepare your support all alone and then breaking your fast alone as well. Worse, some converts experience antagonism from their families of origin who have not accepted their conversion to Islam and what they may view as the extremism of fasting. 
While converts‘ struggles are becoming widely recognized and providing care for converts gets a lot of buzz in Muslim communities, structured assistance lags. 
In 2021, the Convert Muslim Association in the United Kingdom dedicated its Ramadan fundraising to a multi-tiered approach to supporting recent converts to Islam. CMA’s goals were a Convert Care Mapping website to locate care services for converts, a Resettlement and Rehabilitation project for converts leaving the prison system, and a Faithful Companions one-to-one service providing flexible, direct care to converts 
Also in 2021, there were many people referring to the Eid holiday in lockdown, helping other Muslims experience how converts feel every Eid that they spend alone.
Eids like no others
Eid can also be a painful time for some American Muslims who may spend it alone or have to work. But for the majority of Muslim communities, Eid al-Fitr (after Ramadan) is a much bigger affair than Eid al-Adha (honoring Ibrahim’s sacrifice).
Most women attend the Eid morning prayer along with men and children, then families and friends spend the day together if they receive time off from work. In addition to receiving clothes, as is the tradition on Eid al-Fitr, many children are given toys as well. 
Some Eid al-Fitr celebrations run along the lines of backyard barbecues with inflatable bouncy houses for the kids or renting out play-places for the day. From New York to California, larger outdoor “Eid Festivals” held in parks and recreation areas attract thousands of Muslims in the regions. 
US presidents host an Eid al-Fitr dinner that is said to have first been held by Thomas Jefferson in 1805 for a Tunisian envoy. In 1996, former First Lady Hillary Clinton suggested another Eid dinner and it has been hosted ever since. Only former President Donald Trump and the COVID-19 situation have broken the annual tradition.

177,Building a Culture of Recycling: A Must for Moroccan Communities,"An effective recycling culture starts at home, is reinforced at school, and is maintained by the street.",Abdellah Benahnia,"Mar. 31, 2022 11:02 a.m.","Rabat - To address the challenge Morocco faces in teaching communities to recycle, it seems helpful to consider American psychologist B.F. Skinner’s Theory of Operant Conditioning, also known as “habit-formation” or “stimulus-response” theory. Skinner argues that human responses and reactions to particular behaviors play a key role in learning. 
He goes on to explain how positive reinforcement is an effective tool in the learning process, and how repetition reinforces the skills we develop. Skinner uses the term “active” to refer to any “behavior that acts on the environment to generate consequences.” The psychologist’s theory explains how we acquire a set of learned behaviors, and how these behaviors in themselves may become a real skill through repetition and reinforcement. 
Another researcher, Ivan Pavlov, who had already linked learning and the development of skills to repeated behavior prior to Skinner, defines this learning process as the formation of a habit. Building on Pavlov's work, learning theory asserts that habit formation is a mechanical process, sustained by repeated reinforcement of the stimulus-response sequence. 
With this in mind, could we introduce and develop a culture of recycling through different educational channels, and reinforce positive behavior into habit? This question requires us to think about various aspects of the learning process itself, and reflect on the roles of the family, the school, and the street in instilling and strengthening a recycling culture and related skills, for the benefit of individuals and society alike.
Role of the family in reinforcing acquired Skills
As I have explained before in other articles, the learning process occurs in three interconnected spheres - within the family, at school, and on the street. If learning in one area is flawed, progress in other areas suffers too. For example, if school education is mediocre, this will inevitably affect behavior within the family and on the street. 
Or if the family fails to fulfill its role as the first educator of the child, this will negatively affect behavior on the street and learning at school. Even if the school is excellent and the family performs its duty, but the street teaches crime, disrespect, and moral decline, there is no doubt that the school and the family’s efforts will be in vain, and we will not be able to build a strong, fortified, and solid society.
Culture of recycling starts at home
An effective recycling culture starts at home, is reinforced at school, and is maintained by the street. Since the family is the first educator of the child, the first micro-community a child encounters in his or her life, it has a great responsibility to teach the necessary skills and positive values that will help a child hone and develop their skills further at school and on the street, through actual practice, communication, and positive reinforcement. 
Based on Skinner's theory, children can acquire several positive behaviors at home provided that the family reinforces them and protects children from developing negative or dangerous habits. There is no doubt that families have the power to instill many cultural values in their children, including behaviors linked to the culture of recycling, such as sorting waste from the kitchen. The family’s role is to raise young people who respect positive rituals and principles from an early age.
Does the street reflect what we learn at school and at home?
We can talk about civilization, sophistication, and development, but the street remains the mirror that reflects the reality of our progress in terms of behavior, communication, and human interaction. In other words, our behavior in the street is the true measure by which we can test the effectiveness of learning at home and the extent of the school's success in instilling positive values and virtuous morals in our generations. 
Recycling is only a small part of our diverse culture, which, unfortunately, is manifested only in the sorting of bread from the rest of our waste for religious reasons. It is really sad to see people throwing garbage bags everywhere, discarding them in front of houses, or tossing them from a car window - not to mention cigarette butts in the street, and people spitting or urinating in public without shame! 
These acts are indeed disgusting, and we regularly hear obscene speech on streets and roads, along with motorbikes blaring late at night for no reason (speaking of which, we salute the security men carrying out campaigns against this strange phenomenon in our society). These actions are relatively new habits, contrary to the principles and education of Islam.
Unfortunately, we are still lagging behind at the national level when it comes to recycling - other countries started teaching and acquiring recycling as a skill more than a decade ago. Therefore, in order to preserve the cleanliness of the environment and the climate in general, the state should promote this culture through multiple actions, starting by providing different colored or shaped containers specific to each category of waste, including unwanted bread, fruits, and vegetables, paper, glass, metals, electrical waste, and electronic devices, plastics, clothing, textiles, and so on.

Recycling these materials is vital for ensuring that our environmental footprint is reduced and water consumption minimized. In parallel, the government can provide special refuse bags at subsidized and cheap prices and conduct awareness-raising campaigns through television and radio programs, social media, mosques, schools, and various civil society associations. 
Without a doubt, the presence of an awareness-raising momentum of this magnitude, supported by real-world tools and resources, would implement and promote a culture of recycling, and reinforce positive habits. Perhaps it may even motivate and encourage people across the country to take pride in their societies and improve behavior on the streets, helping to spread civilized habits, maintain a clean ecological environment, and reflect our cultural level.  
It is a test of genuine interest in preserving our neighborhoods and public domain, a test of our commitment to positive values and principles. We all, as a nation, need to strive for a clean society in every sense and teach our children that recycling is the responsibility and concern of every individual.

178,Global Terrorism Index 2022: Morocco Among the World’s Safest Countries,"According to the Global Terrorism Index 2022, Morocco is one of the safest nations, with terrorism having a “very low impact.”",Aya Benazizi,"Mar. 29, 2022 6:53 p.m.","Casablanca - Morocco is one of the safest countries worldwide, the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) said in its latest “Global Terrorism Index” (GTI). 
With an overall score of 1.156 and a global rank of 76th among countries impacted by the terrorist threat, the report found, Morocco’s counter-terrorism efforts in the past years have put it on a restricted list of countries that have devised an effective mechanism to deal with the threat of terrorism in its diverse, emerging forms.
“Morocco’s active role in fighting terrorism suggests the country’s understanding of the threat; the interconnectedness of its counterterrorism methods,” the report said. “The application of combined soft and hard measures; the facilitation of information sharing practices; and the promotion of international cooperation as the sine qua non of counterterrorism.”
Released earlier this month, on March 1, this year’s GTI explores the impact of terrorism on nations and its many trends in the past twelve months, while also assessing the direct and indirect consequences of terrorism, such as the number of lives lost, injuries, property damage, and psychological aftereffects. 
The report is a composite score that rates countries based on the impact of terrorism, ranging from 0 (no impact) to 10 (great impact/highest impact).
Morocco’s ranking in context
Morocco’s overall score, 1.156, means that while terrorist groups surely continue to have the North African country on their radar as a target, the impact of terrorism is “very low” in Morocco. The suggestion is that, with regular news of Moroccan counter-terrorism units dismantling terrorist cells, the country remains a bulwark in the ongoing global and regional fight against emerging terrorism threats.   
Meanwhile, Morocco’s ranking in this year’s GTI indicates that the country has moved up only two places compared to its 2021 performance (when it ranked 74th worldwide) and twenty-six places compared to its 2020 performance. Two years ago, the North African country ranked 102nd on the list of nations affected by terrorism. 
But Morocco is still in the second position in the Maghreb, trailing only Mauritania, which is ranked 84th worldwide with a score of 0.509. Algeria comes in third position (39th in the world) with a score of 4.432, followed by Tunisia (38th, 4.447) and Libya (26th, 5.100).
Meanwhile, Morocco is the sixth least afflicted by terrorism in North Africa and the Middle East region, behind the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Sudan. 
Casablanca attacks changed the game for Morocco 
Morocco's significant efforts in combating terrorism constitute the main factor in the country’s largely positive GTI performances over the past years. Following the Casablanca bombings in 2003, Morocco embarked on a radical shift in its counter-terrorism approach.
On May 16, 2003, 12 members of al-Salafiya al-Jihadiya, a Salafi-jihadi terrorist organization connected with Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), blew themselves up in Casablanca.
The Farah Hotel, the Jewish Community Centre, a Jewish restaurant, a Jewish cemetery, and a Spanish social club were all targeted in the terrorist attacks.
The Casablanca terror assaults triggered a new phase of globally inspired domestic terrorism, with similar but significantly less lethal incidents being witnessed again in Casablanca in 2007 and 2015, in Marrakech in 2011, and in 2018 in Imlil.
The 2003 Casablanca attacks and following terrorist incidents spurred Morocco's government to strengthen its counter-terrorism measures in response to new, emerging terrorist tactics -- quickened operational tempo and increasing lethality.
Aside from legislative reforms that strengthened Morocco's legal counter-terrorism framework, the Moroccan government acknowledged that the 2003 attacks necessitated a comprehensive response.
In fact, Moroccan law enforcement's accomplishments in preventing attacks while adhering to the rule of law and human rights set a positive example for the rest of the continent.
In order to prevent terrorists' passage in and out of the nation, Morocco attempted to improve border management and better educate and equip law enforcement and security forces. Morocco began executing a tri-dimensional counter-terrorism strategy, which aims to handle several aspects of the terrorist threat through security, socioeconomic development strategies, and religious assistance.
Since 2004, Moroccan security services have dismantled almost 200 terrorist networks, made over 3,500 terrorism-related arrests, and prevented over 300 planned terrorist attacks.
As a result, Morocco became significantly more involved in global counter-terrorism initiatives, including joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and co-chairing the Global Counterterrorism Forum's Foreign Terrorist Fighter Working Group (GCTF).
Morocco has also collaborated extensively with US and European counter-terrorism initiatives. In 2011, Morocco became a founding member of the Global Counterterrorism Forum, joining the United States and 28 other nations.
Morocco, an example of effective counter-terrorism
Morocco has also stepped up its already strong counter-terrorism measures, both domestically and internationally. As a result, the North African country has become a worldwide leader in the fight against terrorism and an inspiration for many African countries seeking to invest in their counter-terrorism capabilities amid the deepening security crisis in the Sahel.  
Morocco is currently a key international counter-terrorism partner, playing a critical role in safeguarding and strengthening regional and continental peace, security, and stability. Its counter-terrorism architecture and the operational capabilities of its specially trained security officers have all made the country an important actor in the African and global security landscape. 
In 2020, Morocco signed a host nation agreement with the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) to create a Programme Office for Counter-Terrorism and Training in Africa.
With its newly established office in Rabat, the first of its kind on the African continent, the UNOCT serves as a training hub for counter-terrorism, law enforcement, border security management, combating radicalization, and safeguarding human rights in the battle against terrorism.
More recently, Morocco has also shared intelligence that has resulted in the arrest of terrorists or the averting of attacks in France, Belgium, India, Italy, Spain, Germany, Burkina Faso, and Sri Lanka.
As the 2022 GTI suggests, however, being ranked among the safest countries in the world was not an easy endeavor for Morocco; it took strategy, hard effort, and strategic intelligence cooperation with the country’s reliable allies and security partners.

179,Who Are the Current Winners and Losers of the Ukraine Crisis?,"After a month of fighting, the current crisis is producing a list of clear winners and losers",Jasper Hamann,"Mar. 26, 2022 1:41 p.m.","Rabat - A month ago, Russian forces entered Ukraine, sparking a conflict that is already producing a clear list of winners and losers that is likely to impact the world’s future.  International media is obsessed with which side is “winning” the conflict, but amid the fog of war  the reality appears to be that no side has a chance of anything resembling a victory.
In the”fog of war” no one can truly determine the situation on the ground, allowing for a flurry of disingenuous messaging from both Russia and Ukraine. 
The reality of any modern conflict is that war ends with either total defeat for one side (as in the US invasion of Iraq), or more commonly through peaceful negotiations, ideally through the UN’s conflict resolution mechanisms. These mechanisms commonly include initial peace negotiations, such as recently seen in Libya, followed by truth and reconciliation commissions, efforts to disarm the population and other trust building endeavors.
But given the current diplomatic isolation of Russia by numerous countries, traditional conflict resolution could itself fall victim to the onslaught on Europe’s eastern borders.

The conflict’s losers
Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine is producing a long list of unfortunate victims and, as is common in conflict, always those who were not involved in the decision to go to war in the first place. 
Citizens on the ground
Ukraine’s citizens top the list of clear victims of this conflict. Trapped between the geopolitical considerations of the world’s largest nuclear powers, Ukrainians face an impossible task. 
Media in the West have been eagerly cheering on the arming and deployment of citizens in the conflict, painting the resistance movement as a legitimate force that has the opportunity to stand up to Russia’s superior military through sheer grit and love of country.
Pulitzer-prize winning former war-reporter Chris Hedges emphasizes that arming citizens does little but produce cannon-fodder against a well-trained military force such as Russia’s. “The media loves this heroic narrative of mothers making molotov cocktails, but the dark reality is that you are just setting them up to be killed,” Hedges stated in a recent interview.
In many ways, Ukrainian citizens have become the West’s “freedom fighters,” despite their obvious inability to produce a short-term resolution to the conflict.
Meanwhile Hedges warns that “history, as well as all the conflicts I covered as a war correspondent, have demonstrated that when military posturing begins, it often takes little to set the funeral pyre alight.”
Families across Russia are similarly facing nothing but suffering, as their sons and daughters are asked to fight a war few support wholeheartedly. The decision to directly involve Russian forces in the eight-year old Ukrainian conflict pits two brotherly people against each other in an orgy of reluctant fratricide with no end in sight.
Citizens of the world
The conflict is revealing our economic interdependency, as people around the world  are feeling the conflict’s effects at their dinner tables and local gas stations. A spike in energy prices is having a knock-on effect on food and other costs, intertwined with Russia and Ukraine’s role as major wheat exporters.
Many in the developing world, dependent on cereal imports from Eastern Europe, are seeing the price of bread rise, while the closely-correlated likelihood of local political instability rises alongside it.
Both Russia and Ukraine also make important contributions to the global supply of fertilizer , needed to grow most food items. 
At the same time, the conflict is set to result in a flood of small-arms in the global illicit arms market, while producing a new generation of military-trained angry young men, and a waning sense of global peace and stability.
Free markets and globalization
The renewed conflict in Ukraine is set to again expand the artificial divide between East and West. After decades of Russia’s economic integration into globalized capitalism, international businesses are being shamed into undoing any business dealings in the country. 
The current push to isolate Russia is undoing the multilateral trade interdependence that has long been heralded as a crucial ingredient to creating peace and stability worldwide.
What the initial stages of the conflict revealed is that Egyptian bread depends on Ukrainian farmers, that avocado farmers in Brazil need Russian fertilizers and that Russians also enjoy the Big Macs and Venti Lattes sold in metropoles around the world. 
Yet, this sense of shared humanity and interdependence is rapidly being lost, as the Russian people are set to feel the impact of sanctions and economic isolation, while its former economic partners scramble to source their trade goods from elsewhere.

The conflict’s winners
Determining the “winners” in a conflict can be a difficult task. As former British PM Neville Chamberlain famously said, “in war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers.” The irony of the Ukrainian conflict is that it is unlikely any of the fighting sides can emerge victorious.
Russia appears conscious it cannot fully occupy or annex Ukraine, instead it focuses on solidifying its control over Russian-speaking border regions that can become key elements or bargaining chips in eventual peace negotiations. 
Kyiv similarly knows it cannot stop Russia through any conventional warfare, and that it doesn’t stand a chance against a true shock and awe campaign by Russia. Amid the fog of war, Ukraine appears to be simply releasing news about Russian losses and valiant Ukrainian defense efforts to produce its own narrative to benefit eventual peace negotiations.
With both warring parties conscious about the absence of any real conditions that would signal a victory, the current “winners” of the conflict have little to lose in the ongoing fighting.
The US
Currently, as is common in war, the undisputed beneficiaries of the conflict are located far from the front lines and have little stake in the wellbeing of people in Moscow or Kyiv. 
The conflict in Ukraine has produced immense net positives for the US, boosting its envisioned role as “leader of the free world.” After decades of waning influence and horrific military blunders in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan, the US is rapidly regaining its role as the world’s policeman. 
Over the past five years, the US unilaterally withdrew from three landmark treaties that aimed to ease tensions with Russia, including the Open Skies agreement and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Tensions in the region were on the rise long before the renewed fighting in the Ukraine war, with allegations that the US was even involved in the 2014 revolution that sparked the crisis.
In 2022, unconfirmed US intelligence reports resulted in unprecedented tensions ahead of the renewed fighting in Ukraine, and US media have been eager to support further military action in Ukraine and paint the conflict as a precursor to World War III. With little scrutiny, the West rallied behind the US, providing confidence within Ukraine that the West would be there to defend its borders from any Russian incursion. 
As Russian boots crossed the Ukrainian border however, it became clear that the West was predictably unwilling to risk war with nuclear-armed Russia, instead opting to flood Ukraine with weapons as a means of “support.” This highly profitable yet risk-averse approach effectively pits Ukrainian citizens against professional Russian soldiers, and undermines any effort towards conflict resolution. 
Meanwhile the narrative of a Cold War-style “domino-effect” has again taken root, promoting dangerous escalation through the idea that a Russian “victory” in Ukraine would embolden it to attack NATO members despite their membership-related security guarantees. 
Yet in the US, President Joe Biden can declare himself to be a “war-time president,” ahead of contentious midterm elections, while the US is once again the clear leader of Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), spurring on military expenditures that arms manufacturers across the US are welcoming with open arms.
Furthermore, the current conflict is helping the US resolve long-term points of friction within the NATO alliance. It has pushed Germany to expand military spending and voluntarily end its expanded gas pipeline with Russia, increasing Europe’s dependency on US gas. Meanwhile the conflict is further leveraged to attempt to push Turkey back into NATO’s good graces. 
NATO
Another clear beneficiary of the conflict is NATO itself. Having lost its clear mandate to defend against Soviet Russia in the 1990s, the alliance is once again seen as a value tool against the tyranny of international real-politik. Less than three years after having been declared “brain dead” by French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO is  alive and kicking.
Yet, few have questioned to what degree NATO itself is a player in this realpolitik. For decades US and NATO officials have warned that the eastward expansion of NATO would trigger a new conflict with Russia, undermining decades of Russian efforts to integrate into global markets and diplomatic forums.
With Russia again being presented as a threat to global peace (conveniently ignoring the West’s role in the ongoing conflict in Yemen and its role in the greater Middle-East) NATO has reinvigorated its mandate. Facing a new threat, NATO members are voluntarily boosting their military spending, a noticeable change after decades of ignoring NATO demands to spend a larger share of their GDP on the military.
The specific demand for NATO members to spend a specific amount of their resources on the military has made NATO an important tool to expand global arms sales amid a global context that is relatively more peaceful than any time in the past.
Arms manufacturers
No one is set to benefit from the current conflict as much as international arms manufacturers. From Boeing to Raytheon, the stock prices of arms manufacturers have soared in the US and Britain, benefiting multinationals with far-reaching influence on governments in London and Washington. 
Few have wondered what will happen in the coming years to the thousands of assault rifles, rocket-launchers and other “defensive” weapons being sent to Ukraine. Even fewer have wondered what will happen once the fighting dies down and a generation of frustrated, well-armed and trained irregular soldiers seek new economic opportunities and an outlet for their anger.
Such remnants of conflict have fueled new wars and instability in the last decade. The flood of weapons and fighters in Libya helped oust Muammar Ghaddafi, and still fuels conflict across the Sahel to this day. Such unfortunate consequences are more rule than exception in the messy business of foreign interference in conflict. 
Western arms manufacturers couldn’t find a “better” conflict than the current clash in Ukraine. It isolates its main competitors in Russia, spurs on military spending, and dismisses the idea that more weapons lead to a more volatile and unsafe world for all of us.

Sacrifices on the altar of war
While there are currently undisputed winners and losers to the ongoing conflict, the war is set to create an altogether greater and more holistic threat to us all. 
Good versus Evil
The current war has shown that in the 21st century, we are all still drawn into the dualistic Manichean view of “good versus evil.” This notion clouds our judgment, eviscerates options for conflict resolution and paints our enemies as motivated by nothing but an incomprehensible sense of malice and stereotypical villainy.
The way in which Russian President Vladimir Putin has been painted in Western media, as motivated only by a pure sense of erratic wickedness, undermines any effort to see both sides’ perspective, a key component in the UN’s conflict resolution mechanisms. 
Meanwhile, the international isolation of Russia at all diplomatic and economic platforms risks pushing the country into a corner from which it can never leave without losing face. 
Military strategists throughout history have recognized the importance of leaving an avenue for your surrounded foe to retreat. 
From Chinese strategist Sun Tzu and the tactics of the Mongol empire up to modern warfare, it is generally recognized that without means for escape, a surrounded enemy will fight to the death. Therefore it is in both sides' advantage to avoid such a situation by allowing a corridor for escape, in order to save lives and reduce the violence needed to subdue a foe.
Dangerous isolation
The current isolation of Russia is meant to punish Russia for its clear breach of post-Nuremberg conventions on interstate warfare, yet risks fueling even greater conflict if there is no path left towards peace through diplomacy. 
As with any conflict, the greatest victims are likely to be future generations, in Eastern Europe and across the globe. The Ukraine conflict appears set to undermine a sense of global security, stability and peace, boost militarism, and pit the West against the East in a renewed Cold War. 
After two decades of a unipolar world led by the US, the conflict is set to once again ask governments around the world to “pick a side,” as divisions and tensions are fueled by mutual mistrust and misunderstandings. 
Finding a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian conflict demands us to attempt to understand both sides of the conflict, and eschew notions of a black-and-white conflict between pure good and evil. 
Russia’s geopolitical concerns can be assuaged without surrendering Ukrainian territory, while reducing international arms proliferation, strengthening arms control treaties and limiting the risk of fueling further wars. 
Geopolitical realism vs 21st century “rights”
Renowned internal political scientist, veteran and West Point-graduate John Mearsheimer describes the conflict as a logical reaction by Russia, and Ukrainian and international resistance to the conflict as a misunderstanding of the reality of global realpolitik. 
Mearsheimer emphasizes that the US itself would never allow a foreign foe to exert undue influence over its neighbors and could use its Monroe Doctrine to intervene militarily if its neighbors would use their legal autonomy to do so. It is a global misunderstanding of the rights of nations, Mearsheimer argues, that is causing a disconnect on the Ukraine conflict. 
“States usually pay attention to international law as long as they are in their strategic interests,” he argues in a recent interview. However, he adds that “if there is a conflict between international law and a country’s strategic interest, the country will always privilege its strategic interests, and international law and human rights will be pushed off the table.”
”In the international system, might makes right,” Mearsheimer describes as the driving factor behind both Russian and US foreign policy.
For an internal relations expert such as Mearsheimer, the conflict can easily be resolved if Ukraine recognizes the geopolitical reality and finds a modus vivendi with Russia. “If the Ukrainians were smart, they would divorce themselves from the United States,” Mearheimer recommends.
While peace and diplomacy is an available option that both sides of the conflict are likely to favor, sensationalist international media continue to ignore any meaningful discussion on conflict resolution. 
“Even if the Russians lose, in the process they will destroy Ukraine”, Mearsheimer warned before adding that “from Ukraine’s point of view, that’s not a good thing.”
Mearsheimer’s analysis has since led to University of Chicago students trying to “cancel” him, accusing him of “Putinism” and presenting “anti-Ukrainian ideology” for not neatly aligning with the problematically uniform media narrative on the conflict.
Driven by the black-and-white “othering” of Russia and its leadership, Putin’s Russia has been demonized to the point where negotiations would be seen as a “deal with the devil.” Meanwhile, sanctions and ongoing fighting are unlikely to resolve the conflict. 
As long as the media and politicians focus more on who is “winning” the conflict in the short-term, we risk forgetting what we all could lose in the long-term.

180,Meet Morocco’s Majda Brabije: The African Champion of Speed Reading and Mind Mapping,"From corporate finance to speed reading and mind mapping, Majda Brabije’s journey has just begun.",Souad Anouar,"Mar. 25, 2022 11:25 a.m.","Rabat - Morocco and Africa’s Speed Reading and Mind Mapping Champion Majda Brabije has transcended expectations to lead Moroccan youth towards successful academic and professional careers. 
Ranking 9th in the 2021 World Championship of Speed Reading and Mind Mapping, Brabije felt “very honored to represent” her country. 
In an exclusive interview with Morocco World News, Brabije shared her journey as a student of speed reading and mind mapping then as the coach of Moroccan candidates for the upcoming world championship. 
Her inspiring story provides guidance to Moroccan youth wishing to excel in academic and professional careers. 
Educated in corporate finance, Brabije learned about speed reading and mind mapping while preparing for her Ph.D. dissertation at Hassan II University in Ain Chock, Casablanca. 
“I discovered this technique accidentally. Actually, I was preparing for my Ph.D. and I was a working mom. I didn’t have enough time to read all the articles. I was looking for something to help me read faster and also retain all the information,” she told MWN. 
A simple google search introduced the Moroccan champion to the world of speed reading and mind mapping. 
Speed Reading as brain sport and life necessity
Through practice, Brabije mastered the fundamentals of speed reading and mind mapping skills.
As a “brain sport,” speed reading or what she prefers to call “smart reading” is a “superpower.” 
“It helps develop all 21st-century skills, critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity,” she noted, adding that the skills are today a “must-have not nice to have skills” as they “unleash our potential as humans.”
Renowned billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have both said that speed reading is a superpower as it saves the reader time and effort.

Viewed as a superpower, it is a necessity for ambitious students and professionals. Giving the example of the US, Brabije noted that primary schools and top 500 companies in the states implemented training on speed reading and mind mapping. 
Training others, a noble life mission 
To assist Moroccan youth, the African champion has coached over 2000 people within different establishments. “More than 90% of them have noticed a very important change” in their reading by the end of their training, she said. 
Her coaching focuses on the skills of speed reading, mind mapping, concentration, and memorization. Brabije asks her students to practice daily for ten minutes as she believes that “small achievements are better than bigger ones if they are done consistently.”
The training schedule includes three minutes of breathing exercise before reading. The first step helps collect the reader’s attention, then they warm up their eyes.
Following the important two steps, the readers have to use peripheral vision, which entails focusing on the middle of the text as the brain picks up the words in the margins. 
On top of these steps, Brabije recommends taking notes as it ensures efficient reading and understanding of the content. 
With five simple steps, commitment, and practice, everyone can develop speed reading and mind mapping skills, stressed the Moroccan champion. 
“We have all the possibility and huge potential to unleash. We just have to believe in ourselves because humans are very powerful and our brain is limitless,” pointed out Majda Brabije. 
Training future world champions
As the Moroccan champion considers sharing knowledge and expertise as her life mission, she initiated the first training and coaching program in Morocco and Africa for speed reading and mind mapping. 
Through her Super Brain program, Brabije seeks to prepare the first Moroccan “brain athletes team” to participate in the upcoming world championship. 
The program provides “a unique experience to develop memory, concentration, analytical skills, critical thinking, creativity as well as the spirit of challenge through participation in the world championship of speed reading and mind mapping.”
Super Brain is organized in partnership with Club de Lecture: Ville Verte, APAC, RETZ editions, the Mind Mapping Academy, Passion d’Apprendre, and the France Championship of Speed Reading and Mind Mapping.
The four-month training program started in February and is expected to end in May with participants taking mind mapping and speed reading tests on May 26 and 29. 
The participants will take four tests, three on mind mapping of oral and written content and one on speed reading a book. 
These challenges enable them to develop multiple skills such as active listening, critical analysis, synthesis, creativity, memorization, and concentration, noted the organizers. 
Through Super Brain, Majda Brabije is not only providing future generations with superpowers but also building a legacy founded on knowledge sharing and critical training.

181,Explained: Royal Air Maroc’s Suspended Trainee Pilots,"Amid unanswered demands, suspended trainee pilots continue to urge Royal Air Maroc to find a “just” solution to their case.",Safaa Kasraoui And Souad Anwar,"Mar. 22, 2022 5:27 p.m.","Rabat - Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and the case of its trainee pilots continue to make local headlines. Reports on the situation have been sweeping social media, with opinions on the dispute divided. 
COVID-19: RAM’s financial dilemma
During a Covid-induced economic crisis Royal Air Maroc, the national carrier suspended work contracts of 105 trainee pilots who were part of a three-year training program, which should have ensured them employment with the national flag carrier after completing it.
In March 2020, Morocco introduced a state of emergency under which authorities imposed a total lockdown and closure of airspace as part of its campaign to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
The situation affected state carrier Royal Air Maroc, which declared huge tremendous financial losses, and in May 2020, Royal Air Maroc’s CEO Abdelhamid Addou said the company was losing MAD 50 million ($5.15 million) per day, making the situation the “worst crisis” in the company’s history.
What was the program?
The training program, where participants spend the first two years in France’s National School of Civil Aviation of Toulouse and the final year in Morocco, was part of the airline's contract deal with the trainee pilots. The agreement then says that the company will sign a permanent employment contract with the trainee pilots following the three-year training.
Royal Air Maroc partnered with banks to loan the trainees money to pay for the MAD 1 million ($102,116) program (for each trainee). The loan agreement then stipulated trainees to pay back the money over 10 years after signing their official recruitment contract with Royal Air Maroc.
RAM’s suspension and alternative 
Due to the COVID-19-induced financial crisis, however, Royal Air Maroc suspended  105 trainee pilots.
The initial contract suspension of the trainee pilots covered a seven months period that was then extended for another year, until April 2022. 
But this meant the trainees could not pay their loan installments. Therefore,  Royal Air Maroc paid the loans back to banks.
Royal Air Maroc then proposed another recruitment contract with Atlas Multiservice, a company affiliated with the Moroccan airline. 
But the pilots rejected the offer under which  Royal Air Maroc said Atlas Multiservice would pay the trainee pilots a salary less than what the national carrier had previously promised them.
Amid uproar from the trainee pilots, Royal Air Maroc then filed a lawsuit against three trainee students, urging them to pay their loan debts.
No official words on the case
Royal Air Maroc has not responded to a request for comment from  Morocco World News.
Mohammed Sebbari, a member of the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) addressed a written question to Minister of Transport and Logistics Mohammed Abdeljalil. 
In the written question, the parliamentarian asked the minister to explain the airline’s rationale behind its actions, particularly its decision to offer an alternative recruitment contract through Atlas Multiservice that includes a deduction of 45% from the initially promised wages.
Youssef Yassir, one of the trainee pilots affected by Royal Air Maroc’s suspension, told Morocco World News last week that he was “astonished” by the company’s refusal to provide financial support to them amid the financial crisis.
He claimed that Royal Air Maroc asked the trainee pilots to submit a request asking for the termination of their training contract.
Yassir also said that the company asked the trainees to send recruitment requests  to “another company.” 
The company Yassir mentioned potentially refers to the Atlas Multiservice company that the Moroccan MP in his question to the Minister of Transport. 
Yassir, who is also a member of the coordination of RAM trainee pilots, joined the program in 2017 before his Royal Air Maroc’s contract was suspended in August 2020, while completing his third year of training in Morocco. 
The Coordination of RAM Trainee Pilots was set up during the tussle over the work contracts and represents the interests of those whose contracts the airline suspended. Earlier this month the ground said in a press release that the national carrier  is ""tarnishing its image and reputation.""
Yassir accused Royal Air Maroc of offering a  “take it or leave it” deal that does not meet their demands.
“I could not, in any case, break my contract with the company carrying the flag of Morocco, which is my sponsor, which is the guarantor of my training, to go and throw myself into the arms of another company that I do not know,” said Yassir.
The complaints and outcry are not targeting Royal Air Maroc as a company but rather addressing the carrier’s management, he stressed.
“We are 105, we had the same training under the same conditions. We all deserve to be treated the same way,” Yassir argued.

182,Profile: Biden Nominates Puneet Talwar for Morocco Top Envoy,"MENA-expert Talwar was nominated for the position of ambassador to Morocco, considered a key leadership position by the president.",Jasper Hamann,"Mar. 19, 2022 3:17 p.m.","Rabat - US President Joe Biden on Friday announced he will nominate diplomat Puneet Talwar  for the position of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Morocco. Biden announced Talwar’s coming nomination in a March 18 press release, along with four other nominees for positions in the Biden administration.
Talwar’s appointment to lead the US embassy in Morocco brings a foreign policy professional, not a career diplomat, to Morocco. As has been common over the past 60 years with US appointees to the role of ambassador to Morocco, Talwar is a clear political appointee by Biden, who is sending a trusted advisor to lead diplomatic efforts in Morocco.
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
The pending nomination of Talwar would make him the top US official in Morocco, with full authority to represent the US and the Biden administration in the North African country.
The US sees the role of “Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary” for which Talwar is nominated as being “at the apex” of the US embassy in Morocco. Filling this position allows the US to facilitate easier cooperation with Morocco and streamline the decision-making process at the embassy.
Now that Biden has announced Talwar as his intended nominee, the veteran diplomat will first be evaluated by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who have to approve his nomination.
Should it approve Tawlar’s appointment, the committee will send the nomination to the US Senate for a vote. As part of the US system of checks and balances, any senator can delay the nomination process until the moment the senate votes on the nominee.
Close advisor to Biden
Puneet Talwar is a DC-born veteran public servant with a close personal working relationship with US President Joe Biden. Talwar holds an engineering bachelor and a master degree in international affairs and has served as a close advisor to Biden since the nineties. 
He served as chief advisor to then-Senator Biden between 1995 and 1999, when he joined the US State Department as part of its strategic Policy Planning Staff. In 2001 he rejoined Joe Biden as Chief Advisor on the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia to serve Biden for seven years in his role on the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
Biden ascended to the role of US vice-president following the election of Barack Obama in 2008, and Puneet Talwar became an integral part of the new administration. Talwar took part in the Obama administration’s top foreign policy decision-making as Foreign Policy Advisor for the United States House of Representatives.
Foreign policy expert
Besides his advisory role for US Congress, Talwar served on the important US National Security Council as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Iraq, Iran, and the Gulf States for five years. 
After five years at the National Security Council, then-President Obama nominated the foreign policy expert for the role of Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. Talwar has been credited with having had a key role in the realization of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal, which temporarily reduced tensions with Iran until the Trump administration nixxed the agreement.
Tawlar’s time in the halls of power in the US ended in 2015, when he joined the private sector and served as senior member of several NGOs and universities. He has filled functions at the Asia Society Policy Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, NGO InterMediate and Georgetown University until Biden’s election in 2020, when he was asked to join the presidential transition team. 
Talwar in Morocco
Biden’s nomination of his former close advisor to the role of ambassador in Morocco with extraordinary and plenipotentiary authority is likely a sign Biden is taking Morocco very seriously. 
Talwar’s experience within the world’s most powerful foreign policy circles and his track record on the Iran deal appears to indicate that Biden is looking for an experienced deal-maker to head the US embassy in Morocco.
Once confirmed, the Indian-American diplomat’s presence at the US embassy in Morocco would ensure close relations with the US president, and have a veteran diplomat in charge of the diplomatic mission in Rabat.  
With Morocco closely connected to several geopolitical trends, including security in the Sahel, climate change, terrorism and migraton, the appointment of a close confidant of Biden is likely an indication of further collaboration between Rabat and Washington.

183,Analysts: Spain’s Historic Shift on Western Sahara Reflects Morocco’s Diplomatic Strength,Spain’s declaration of support for Morocco’s territorial integrity is a major setback for the Algerian regime and the Polisario Front.,Safaa Kasraoui,"Mar. 18, 2022 6:06 p.m.","Rabat - The Moroccan government today celebrated Spain’s positive declaration of support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, confirming it to be the most serious and credible solution to resolving the Western Sahara conflict.
Today, Spain officially recognized Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and viable solution to ending the decades-long conflict over Western Sahara.
The European country also emphasized the importance of its bilateral relationship with Morocco, expressing certainty the Spanish and Moroccan governments both share a strong desire to build “a new relationship, based on transparency that corresponds to a great friend and ally.”
“I assure you that Spain will always keep its commitments and its word,”  Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a letter to King Mohammed VI.
Although unexpected, the Sanchez government’s recent attempts to repair relations signal clearly that Spain would like to move past the recent deterioration of diplomatic relations between Rabat and Madrid.
Commenting on Spain’s decision, foreign policy analyst Samir Bennis said in a series of tweets that  Spain’s declaration reflects Morocco’s strengthened diplomatic policy in  recent years.
It is also the fruit of Morocco’s “patience and belief in its just cause, which enjoys the support of all the components of the Moroccan people, who sacrificed dearly and preciously in order to preserve Morocco’s territorial integrity,” he argued.
Morocco and Spain’s relationship fell into an unprecedented diplomatic crisis in 2021, after the European country decided to shelter separatist leader of the Polisario Front Brahim Ghali for hospitalization in April 2021.
Ghali landed in Spain in secrecy, but within a few days Morocco’s intelligence learned of the Polisario leader's arrival in the European country. 
Spain’s actions greatly angered Rabat, who said that the move undermined Morocco’s trust in its long-term strategic ally.
Since then, the Spanish government has made several attempts to restore normality and positive diplomatic ties between the two countries.
Spain’s recognition of Morocco's Autonomy Plan as the most credible solution to the Western Sahara conflict, reveals that the European country has stopped  relying on Algerian gas, creating alternatives to “free itself from Algeria’s pressures,” according to Bennis.
Spain’s  supportive position regarding Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara is also taking into account   common interests that the European country shares with Morocco 
The analyst continued to add that Spain had “failed to take this step earlier due to its heavy dependence on Algerian gas.”
“Algeria is paying for its hatred and ingratitude towards Morocco,” he said, recalling the Algerian’ regime's refusal to renew the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline contract.
The contract for the pipeline, which had been supplying Spain with gas through Morocco, expired in October 2021. 
The decision to suspend the contract came a few months after Algeria’s unilateral decision to cut diplomatic relations with Morocco.
“When  the Algerian regime decided to end the gas pipeline linking to Spain through Morocco, it thought that this announcement would weaken Morocco, pushing Spain to side with Algeria’s positions,” Bennis argued.
Following Spain’s energy crisis related to Algeria’s decision to halt the pipeline contract, the Spanish government found out that the Algerian government is not a “credible” partner that can be counted on.
Algeria, the analyst added, is ruled by a “leadership consisting of a group of generals who have no principles” and who do not respect their country’s commitments.
The analyst recalled that Spanish imports of Algeria’s gas account for 23% instead of over 40%.
Spain will turn to Qatari and US markets to import its gas needs, he argued 
Algeria has long challenged Morocco’s positions, particularly its territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara.
The Algerian regime shelters, hosts, finances, and arms the Polisario Front, a separatist group claiming independence for Western Sahara.
Eventful Week
Oualid Kebir, Algerian journalist and political analyst, echoed Bennis’ analysis, saying that this week has been an “eventful one for Morocco’s diplomacy.”
He recalled that the funds directed to Morocco are briefly mentioned under titles III and IV of the latest US spending bill.
The funds appropriated under title III used to be reserved for US funding to “Western Sahara,” Morocco’s southern provinces. 
The analyst told MWN that the Spanish announcement is “momentous,” and “huge victory” for Morocco’s diplomacy.
“It is, on the other hand, a setback for both the Polisario Front and Algeria’s militarized regime,” he argued.
The decision will have a very positive impact on Moroccan-Spanish diplomatic relations, an effect that would be enough to restore normalcy to Rabat-Madrid ties, Kebir concluded.
Appreciating Spain’s positive position, the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the move as “constructive commitments on the issue of the Moroccan Sahara.”
The ministry stressed that Sanchez’ message to King Mohammed VI is a “clear and ambitious roadmap” to improve and advance bilateral diplomatic ties between the two countries.

184,Saloua Ibaline Shares the Stories of Immigrant Women Entrepreneurs,"From Imintanout to Brussels to New York City to the world, each community left its print on Saloua Ibaline’s story and identity.",Souad Anouar,"Mar. 18, 2022 2:17 p.m.","Rabat - Digital nomad and entrepreneurship coach Saloua Ibaline’s journey has intersected with several women who empowered her through tough times, helping her find open doors to possibilities. 
Saloua Ibaline’s inspiring story, and those of 26 immigrant women entrepreneurs, were put together in a moving yet empowering book titled “The Stories of Immigrant Women Entrepreneurs in the United States of America.”
The book reflects the necessity of women's solidarity to reach collective emancipation. 
Ibaline’s story starts with her mother, who had the courage to leave her small, limited world in Imintanout after divorce to live with her sister in France.
Forced to leave her children back home since her ex-husband removed her children from her passport, Saloua Ibaline’s mother moved to a foreign country despite being unfamiliar with the local language and culture and having no financial support. 
She took her newly born daughter Saloua with her to escape “years of misery and suffering” resulting from her divorce.
The mother’s leap of faith started a tough yet fulfilling journey for her daughter as they settled in Belgium after a second marriage with a Moroccan residing there.
The second marriage did not bring much change, with the absence of love and dominance of violence and alcoholism. 
Saloua’s mother had to once again prioritize her well-being and her daughters' safety over cultural expectations. By the time she escaped, she had another daughter, her fifth child. 
Struggling to provide for her children and without a shoulder to lean on in Belgium, Saloua and her sister ended up living part-time at a local host family. For six years, the host family allowed them to feel and act like children. 
Yet the mother did not give up on her children. After years of struggle, she obtained Belgian citizenship, got her first apartment, learned the language, and secured a cleaning job. 
From Europe to the American dream 
At the age of 17, Ibaline moved to Brussels as she “was craving change and independence.” With a “well-rounded education” and mastering four languages, she attended university, worked full time in a restaurant, and received dancing training after work. 
“It was difficult, but I can still feel in my heart that burst of excitement and joy from my first taste of independence,” she wrote. 
With time ticking away, the thrill gradually came to an end. Yet, the “European passport allowed me the freedom to travel anywhere in the world,” she wrote.
Aware of her passport’s power, Ibaline took a one-way ticket to New York City in 2005, replicating in a way her mother’s journey. 
Having only two weeks’ worth of food and lodging and an educational and multilingual background, she embarked on a new freedom-seeking path as she challenged her “culture that often undervalues and underestimates women.” 
Her challenging spirit will allow her to overcome several obstacles such as being kicked out by her host family in the US.  
American dream, struggle, survival 
A pinch of luck was also by Ibaline’s side. As she returned to ground zero like her mom’s humble beginnings, she secured a job as a bartender at a French restaurant and settled in a room in a basement apartment in New Jersey. 
Trying to build a successful life for herself, Ibaline enrolled in a college offering accommodation to students speaking English as a second language to obtain a student visa. 
The visa required having $10,000 in a bank account. A Cuban immigrant, who opened her door to her, financially supported her through the visa process. 
To maintain her student status, she worked tirelessly day and night to excel in studies while working night shifts. Her efforts paid off, as in the end as she graduated with an impressive GPA of 3.95. 
As her college journey came to an end in good terms, it introduced a new challenge; the need for a job to stay in the States.
Here comes a Middle Eastern woman who used to be her boss in a New Jersey restaurant. The lady offered her a job position that enabled her to pursue American citizenship. 
For over five years, she “filled out endless streams of papers” and participated in several interviews, leading her to receive American citizenship in November 2014. 
After almost a decade of struggle, driven-by survival instincts, Saloua Ibaline succeeded to obtain American citizenship to then later assist entrepreneurs in developing their business strategies and digital marketing through private coaching and online courses. 
As a successful story, Ibaline’s journey “is nothing compared to the thousands of immigrants who are still undocumented today and are still struggling to obtain basic American rights,” she noted. 
Yet through her book, she tried to give voice and visibility to dozens of immigrant women entrepreneurs who moved to the US for several reasons including war and conflict as well as for simply chasing the American dream. 
From vivid dream to collection of testimonials 
Like Ibaline’s story, the book’s idea came to life in a fascinating way. In a vivid dream, a voice urged her to document and share the stories of immigrant entrepreneurs. 
Answering the call, she interviewed more than 100 female immigrant entrepreneurs in the United States. 
In the end, 27 stories are featured in the book. They are about women “who dared to follow their entrepreneurial dreams in the United States of America,” said the author. 
The book, she added, “is meant to entertain, educate, and inspire both new and native-born Americans, by highlighting the struggles and success of women who came to this country to improve themselves, their community, and their new nation.”
Coming to the US as babies, teenagers, and adults, the women share different cultural, social, and economic backgrounds yet they all had to fight for their dreams and face structural issues burdening their growth as “only a few options are available for women and women of color entrepreneurs,” stated Ibaline. 
Notably, women-owned businesses in the states generate roughly $1.9 trillion in revenues but female entrepreneurs do not have much access to funding. Thus there is a need for women to invest in women. However, only 18.4% of women occupy investment-level positions in American venture capital firms. 
In addition to funding issues, each woman’s story highlights the pros and cons of living in the US, but they all underline the unique opportunities and freedom they experienced in the states as they were fighting for a personal or social cause. 
All 27 stories note the freedom available in the states and its symbolic meaning to the women immigrant entrepreneurs. Freedom is just a step towards discovering oneself and embracing one’s own culture while adapting to a new one. 
As British-American yoga teacher Susanna Barbataki said in the book, “Immigrant entrepreneurs have the strength of our culture and our roots. We have the promise of radical imagination.”
The balance of resilience and flexibility of the immigrant women define their current identity in connection to the past, present, and future. 
“When you’re uncompromisingly yourself, the world will learn to adjust your presence,” said the Lebanese keynote speaker, Hanadi Chehabeddine.

185,Green Letters to Imams: Your Voice for Real Action on Climate Change,"As the world grapples with ecological emergencies, the Green Letters to Imams initiative promises to shed light on the environmental concerns of Muslims around the globe.",Nadia Mejjati Alami,"Mar. 18, 2022 9:49 a.m.","When UN Secretary General António Guterres announced “Code Red for Humanity” in August of 2021 based on the latest International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) report, the facts were made clear - the Earth requires concerted, worldwide action to heal.
Effective action involves hands-on, far-reaching 'green' projects which facilitate constructive solutions and engage people of all ages in their local neighbourhoods, while teaching and focusing on environmental responsibility.
This month’s launch of a new initiative called Green Letters to Imams is a great example. The initiative invites children and adults worldwide to write letters to their Imams (or ‘community leaders', to use the broadest translation of the Arabic term), including religious, business and political figures, expressing their hopes and fears about climate change and the urgent need to restore the health of our planet.
A special exhibition of selected letters will tour the UK, alongside country profiles and climate-related risks. A dedicated website will be launched to showcase all letters and share them with local, national and international political leaders in the run-up to COP27, which takes place in Egypt between November 7-18. 
This is the first endeavour of a newly-formed alliance called Muslims Declare (a Climate and Ecological Emergency). The objective of Muslims Declare is to foster collaboration across the world's Muslim community and accelerate the essential changes needed locally and globally, including to legislation, to combat the threat of ecological collapse made evident by the IPCC.
Muslims Declare will create opportunities for citizens to share their wisdom and expertise, engage in continued campaigning, and become involved in the decision-making related to 'green' issues, as well as the co-design and application of solutions, all at the grassroots level. In this way, individuals and groups can be actively involved in taking meaningful action to protect the health of the environment and its citizens, in their home communities and beyond.
By showcasing letters from all over the world, Muslims Declare want to amplify the concerns, aspirations and creative solutions from the Global South and strengthen ties between communities. By supporting engagement of faith and diaspora communities, in activities related to the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE), Muslims Declare seeks to give voice to those who are often underrepresented in the political process, and encourage ordinary people to communicate their environmental concerns to their leaders and national decision-makers. 
We are one world and one species, thus in facing the threat of climate change together, we need a conscious evolution towards unity, while appreciating the beauty of our diversity. As our youth across the globe so wisely remind us, cooperative action on climate requires climate justice. 
Muslims Declare are developing the Green Letters to Imams travelling exhibition in partnership with Zero Hour, the campaign for the CEE Bill in the UK. This is a Private Member's Bill, drawn up by scientists and other experts, which Caroline Lucas, a UK Member of Parliament, put before the UK Parliament in September 2020. The CEE Bill seeks to ensure that the UK does its fair share to limit global temperature rise at the most stringent end of the Paris agreement (- 1.5°C) and takes accountability for the country’s entire greenhouse gas footprint, both on home soil and across its supply chains abroad. 
The CEE Bill will safeguard the essential restoration, protection and extension of ecosystems, increasing biodiversity, rebuilding soil and rehabilitating natural carbon sinks. This will be achieved through a climate and nature strategy, designed by a temporary assembly made up of experts and everyday people from diverse backgrounds. This is especially important in our effort to achieve change that prioritises health, sustainable homes, jobs and food systems.
Green Letters to Imams looks set to have a truly positive impact, bringing people together to share their hopes and fears through a creative channel and most significantly, to transform fear into positive, cooperative action.

186,Western Sahara: US Support for Morocco’s Position on Full Display in Latest Spending Bill,"While Biden’s administration has been tepid in its affirmations of support for Morocco, a complete reversal of the US’ newfound Western Sahara policy is highly unlikely.",Safaa Kasraoui,"Mar. 16, 2022 4:58 p.m.","Rabat - The US’ position in favor of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara conflict is no longer subject to appeal and doubt as all actions from the Biden administration are signaling unwavering support for Morocco’s territorial integrity.
The latest indication of the US’ continued support for Morocco’s Sahara stance came in the form of the giant spending bill President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday.
Morocco-directed funds are briefly mentioned on page 591 of the massive, over 2000-page document  under titles III and IV, with the note: “this Act shall be made available for assistance for Morocco.”
Traditionally, the funds appropriated under title III used to be reserved for US funding to “Western Sahara,” Morocco’s southern provinces. However, the fact that title III of this year’s bill  only mentions Morocco constitutes yet another statement of the Biden-Trump continuity on foreign policy issues like the Sahara conflict.
To a large extent, the bill officially indicates that the US’ pro-Morocco position on Western Sahara has become official policy. 
In all previous US bills relating to US assistance to Morocco, US lawmakers made sure to imply that the final status of Western Sahara was still pending and it was not to be considered under Morocco’s sovereignty. 
Introducing some sort of nuance or disclaimer when allocating “Western Sahara” was a signature move by US lawmakers in some of the previous bills’ Morocco sections. For example, they would make the allocation of funds to Morocco contingent on the respect of human rights in the territory and the permission to human rights organizations, journalists, and representatives of foreign governments to visit the Sahara provinces without any sort of restrictions. 
As such, that the latest bill makes no nuanced distinction between “Morocco” and “western Sahara” makes it a far cry from the previous version of the  appropriation bills, especially those of  2008 and 2012. 
From Morocco’s perspective, also illustrative of the Trump-Biden continuity thesis is the bill’s notable mention of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Morocco and the US. Signed in 2004 and put into force in 2006, the FTA has played a critical role in deepening US-Morocco ties in the past decade.  
Significance of the Trump administrations’ ‘normalization’ legacy
But even more plainly indicative is that, in terms of the US’ overall MENA policy, the bill appeared to put special emphasis on how the Trump administration-brokered “normalization” agreements between Israel and several Arab countries, including Morocco, are of paramount importance to Wasgington’s MENA projections.
The recent diplomatic rapprochement between Israel and a number of Arab states has “the potential to fundamentally transform the security, diplomatic, and economic environment in the Middle East and North Africa and advance vital United States national security interests,” the bill argued.
Of note here is the subtle suggestion that Washington intends to uphold the “normalization” agreements, given their security implications and their unique historical and political significance for the US’ MENA interests. 
Stronger relations with Morocco and unequivocal US support for the Moroccanness of Western Sahara were two major points of the Tripartite Agreement Israel, Morocco, and the US signed on the heels of the announcement of the US-assisted “normalization” between Rabat and Tel Aviv. 
And with the US continuing to insist on its commitment to all the terms of the “normalization” agreements, it is only natural to conclude that -- quite to the dismay of the champions of Polisario’s statehood dreams -- Washington intends to honor its agreements with Morocco. 
Critics of such an interpretation may be quick to point out -- as they have done on similar occasions in recent months -- that the Biden-signed spending bill’s tone and language in referencing funds allocated to Morocco is nowhere unequivocally supportive of the Moroccanness of the Sahara.
Steady US support for Morocco
But the fact remains that, while Biden’s administration has been tepid in its affirmations of support for Morocco, numerous statements and actions from the White House, the State Department, and many other US-government affiliated bodies have in recent weeks and months spoken volumes about the unlikelihood of a reversal of the US’ newfound Western Sahara policy.
One such loud statement of the US’ decisively pro-Morocco push on the Sahara issue has been the adoption of an undivided map of Morocco by, among many others, the State Department, the CIA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Immediately after Joe Biden was declared as the US’ president elect, many pro-Polisario voices -- including some long-standing Senators -- appeared to hope for a repudiation of the Trump administration’s recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara.
But judging from the prevailing discourse and sentiment among the Biden administration’s senior diplomats, the consensus remains that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the most viable way out of the decades-long conflict in Western Sahara.
Earlier this month, from March 8 to 9, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman traveled to Morocco to  lead “the U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue on Regional Political Issues,” according to the State Department.
Meeting with Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita during her stay in the country, Sherman stressed that the US still views Morocco’s “serious, credible, and realistic” Autonomy Plan as potentially the most optimal “approach to meet the aspirations of the people of the region.”
Again, one caveat supporters of Polisario’s claims will always point to is the fact that the Biden White House has not been as nearly explicit and vocal as Morocco may have expected since the former administration’s December 10 proclamation. If Washington is indeed incontrovertibly committed to Morocco’s Sahara claims, they might ask, why has the opening of the much-anticipated US consulate in Dakhla been backburned?
The best possible answer is that, with US diplomacy turning its undivided focus to two fronts -- preserving America’s hegemony in theWestern hemisphere in the face of an increasingly bold Russian assertiveness and containing China to maintain US primacy in South East Asia -- issues like Western Sahara could only be put on the backburner. Still, that should be no excuse to suggest, as Samia Errazzouki did recently in a Foreign Policy article, that Morocco is losing the support of “its oldest and strongest ally.”

187,E-Gaming in Morocco: Youth Eager to Challenge Career Status Quo,"Amid increasing digitization and deepening unemployment, many young Moroccans are turning to e-gaming as an alternative to traditional jobs.",Oumaima Latrech,"Mar. 16, 2022 11:29 a.m.","Rabat - The e-sports sector is gaining increasing popularity in today’s tech-driven world, particularly among Generation Z. While some might only consider it a hobby, others are generating money out of the relatively new field and making a professional career out of it.
Even as esports is steadily growing in popularity in Morocco, the older generation,  strong advocates of the traditional nine-to-five jobs, continues to frown upon the multi-billion dollar industry. For most older Moroccans, the very notion of embracing e-gaming as a professional career is essentially the latest fashionable expression of youthful abandon and idleness. 
Though there aren’t exact numbers on how many Moroccans are active on e-game streaming platforms, the industry has in recent years seen an upward trend overall in terms of audiences -- especially during the COVID-19 lockdown. It is believed that there are approximately three million esports enthusiasts in Morocco.
Esports is considerably developing in Morocco due to the ever-increasing digitization and mobile games that have notably contributed to the growth of the gaming business. With many young Moroccans aspiring to pursue a professional career in online gaming, the industry still requires much more professionalism and structure.
As of 2021, the esports market revenue worldwide amounted to $1.08 billion, with China leading the industry in terms of revenues.
East Asian countries are set to take off esports to the next level in the coming years, with Korea expecting to reach $72.5 million in esports revenue by 2024, while Japan will open its first-ever esports high school “Esports Koutou Gakuin” in April this year.
Where will Morocco stand in this innovative industry with a promising potential in creating more career opportunities for youth?
FoxGaming, a leading team in Morocco
As the gaming community continues to grow in the North African country, Morocco World News (MWN) reached out to FoxGaming Team, one of the most successful Moroccan esport teams, for their perspective on the current state and future of e-gaming in Morocco. 
Sharing the story of their own rise as one of the go-to esport teams in the infant but promising Moroccan gaming market, the group spoke notably of the challenges facing this fast-growing industry in a relatively conservative country like Morocco.
The FoxGaming Team represented Morocco in the Intel Arabian Cup (IAC) in 2020. Amine Touzi, the founder of Fox Gaming, and also known as “Islero” in the gaming world, said, “After winning the Moroccan grand finals we had won all the games for two months straight.”
Amine Touzi during his speech at the 2021 LGaming Awards ceremony.
The team played Inwi and Eswc tournaments simultaneously and won both without failing in a single series. 
Touzi stressed that the team has six rosters so far: League of Legends, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, Wild Rift, Rocket League, and Arena of Valor.
Players usually join Discord servers – a chat application widely used by gamers worldwide – to meet like-minded individuals and esports enthusiasts to exchange gaming tactics. Other players also use platforms such as YouTube or Twitch to livestream their game-playing sessions with an audience.
Of the many wins the group has secured since their debut, Touzi recalled their first win at the Africa Game Show in 2017, arguably the biggest gaming tournament to have taken place in Morocco. Now as then, the team’s primary goal is to continue to represent Morocco in world-class tournaments, Touzi stressed. 
The team’s solid -- and growing -- reputation in the industry is not only because they are among the first in the Moroccan video gaming industry. Outside of the still infant Moroccan gaming landscape, Fox Gaming has won both the Valorant and Legends in North Africa, two regional triumphs that have effectively put the Moroccan group on the coveted map of the top-ranked teams in the MENA region. 
With a focus on improving their skills to meet international standards and compete in renowned competitions, Fox Gaming members are mentored by the Brazilian coach Gabriel Garcia Negreiros, an athlete and former goalkeeper with 16 years of experience in sports.
Persisting challenges in the industry
With the older generation being less welcoming of emerging jobs that are more online-oriented, many Moroccan families perceive e-gaming as a hobby that cannot become a “real job.”
But the younger generation has been standing its ground in the face of society’s lingering stereotypes about what should be considered a “real” or “proper” job. When asked about his family reaction after they learnt about his job in Esports management, Touzi said they didn’t take it well at first but eventually became supportive as they saw the great efforts and sacrifices he was making to lead his team to victory in several tournaments.
Unsupportive parents and constant pressure from society are indeed a concern for professional gamers, but among other obstacles in the way of esports-enthusiast young Moroccans are the expensive gaming equipment, slow internet connection, and the lack of regional servers in the MENA.
Of Moroccan society’s failure to acknowledge esports as an actual career, Touzi stressed, “Whether people consider Esports as a sport or not, it doesn't matter because people are training everyday for hours and hours, having an athlete routine, and on top of that, making a living from it.”
So what can be done to positively promote the gaming culture? For Touzi, the answer lies in organizing tournaments and offering gaming equipment in youth centers as well as dedicating the appropriate gaming activities for both primary school and university students.
“Ori And The Blind Forest are very good video games for primary school students to develop their artistic skills, problem solving, and reflex,” he explained. “Video games are a great educational tool if used well. And so on, future naturally talented players will emerge, and that will lead to a huge number of skillful players.”
On March 2, Morocco's Minister of Youth, Culture, and Communication Mehdi Bensaid and the President of Royal Moroccan Federation of Electronic Games (FMRJE) Hicham Lakhlifi signed a partnership to develop the country’s e-gaming industry. 
The two representatives pledged to cooperate in implementing several large-scale opportunities regarding the e-gaming industry.
The FMRJE has also announced that Morocco will feature among participating countries in the FIFAe Nations Series 2022 tournament. 
As a new country in the competition, Morocco will go directly to the online qualifiers of the FIFAe Nations Series 2022, which will take place from May 19 to 22, 2022.
With new opportunities emerging in the e-gaming industry, FoxGaming members aspire to make sustainable progress in the field. As well as proudly representing Morocco on the global stage, the group hopes to gather the professional experience and network they need to improve the esports field in Morocco. 
For them, Morocco’s youth cannot afford to be on the margins of a global revolution of the very idea of what constitutes a professional career. With the traditional labor market failing to absorb the large majority of job seekers, they appeared to suggest, it would be suicidal for Morocco’s technology-savvy millenials not to take advantage of one of the few positive disurptions of the digital age.

188,7 Things to Know About Visiting Morocco in Ramadan,"Witnessing the month of Ramadan for the first time can be a peculiar experience. From a non-Muslim's perspective, the rituals and practices of this holy month are unusual.",Mariya Sahnouni,"Mar. 14, 2022 6:43 p.m.","Every country has a set of societal norms and religious practices that are culturally specific to it. To better comprehend certain cultural practices, it is essential to understand a culture on its own terms, without judging or comparing it with your own culture.
Being aware of unconscious biases and stereotypes, which may affect your view of particular cultures, can enhance your cultural tolerance.
To avoid experiencing culture shock when visiting Morocco in Ramadan, it is necessary to gain knowledge and awareness of Moroccan culture during this holy month.
Moroccan people consider Ramadan to be a sacred month unlike any other. Eating, sleeping, and praying routines change for 30 days and nights.
Eating, Drinking, and Smoking in Public is Offensive
Muslims fast from dawn to dusk during Ramadan. They abstain from food, beverages, smoking, and sexual activity. Breaking this sacred ritual may be regarded as offensive. It is recommended not to eat publicly during fasting hours.
For Moroccan Muslims, eating in public places during the daytime in Ramadan has severe consequences. According to Article 222 of the Moroccan Penal Code “Anyone who is known to have embraced the Islamic religion, and publicly breaks the fast during the day in Ramadan, in a public place, without a legitimate excuse, is penalized and punished by imprisonment from one to six months.’’
Article 222 excludes non-Muslim Moroccan minorities such as Jews and non-Muslim foreigners from the prohibition on eating publicly during the month of Ramadan.
However, Islam is the state religion in Morocco and fasting is one of its main pillars. To avoid any problems and not be offensive, it is recommended not to eat publicly during fasting hours. In other words, when in Rome, do as the Romans do!
The Majority of Local Restaurants, Coffee Shops Close During Fasting Hours
Some local restaurants and coffee shops located in small cities and villages close during the daytime and open until late in the evening to serve the iftar meal. However, there are restaurants and coffee shops that remain open and serve food during fasting hours for tourists, especially in big cities and popular tourist destinations. International food franchises such as McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, and Burger King also serve tourists during Ramadan.

Closure of All Nightclubs and Liquor Stores
Nightclubs and bars close during Ramadan, and the serving and consumption of alcohol are legally banned.
Some Muslims have made it a habit to abstain from alcohol 40 days before the date of Ramadan. They believe that alcohol remains in the human body for forty days, and since alcohol breaks the fast, their body should be alcohol-free before Ramadan.
As Muslims’ prayers are not accepted for 40 days after they have consumed alcohol, some may abstain in order to reap the extra rewards of praying during Ramadan.
If you drink and are visiting Morocco during Ramadan, you will need to stock up on alcoholic beverages before the start of Ramadan.
Working Hours Change During the Holy Month of Ramadan
  The working hours of public institutions change during the holy month of Ramadan, adopting a continuous working time usually from nine in the morning to three in the afternoon, Monday through Friday.
If you plan to visit any public institution, bear in mind that it closes earlier than usual.
Do not plan to go shopping around iftar time as most shops close and reopen after iftar.
It is Preferable to Avoid Wearing Revealing Clothes in Ramadan
 Avoid wearing tight clothes, short skirts, clothes that have low necklines or are above the knees as they can be regarded as indecent, especially during the holy month.
Not Every Muslim Fasts During Ramadan
Do not be surprised if you see some Moroccans eating during Ramadan. It is permissible for people in several situations not to fast during Ramadan. People with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, should not fast. People who are temporarily ill and pregnant or nursing women may not fast if it is a hardship. As well, delicate elderly people are discouraged from fasting.
Muslims who are traveling during Ramadan may also choose not to fast.
Tramdina
The concept of “tramdina’’ refers to a problematic phenomenon in which some fasting people engage in verbal and physical violent acts during fasting hours. 
Abdelkrim El Kanbaï El Idrissi, professor of sociology at the Faculty of Letters and Humanities Dhar El Mahraz in Fez, explains “tramdina” as the conflicts, anxiety, anger, and disputes that people have during fasting.
Reasons for these behaviors vary from addiction withdrawal to changed sleeping schedules and routines.

189,Meet the Growing Vegan Community of Morocco,An all-around peaceful lifestyle is the aim of Moroccans choosing veganism.,Brooke Benoit,"Mar. 14, 2022 12:02 p.m.","Agadir - Vegan tagines and bastilla are not just for tourists visiting Morocco. There is a growing vegan and vegetarian community in the country represented by thousands of Moroccans in social media groups and attending VegFest Morocco.
There are a handful of reasons people choose vegan or vegetarian lifestyles. In general terms, vegetarians do not consume any meat, while vegans also exclude dairy products from their diet. But there is much more to being a vegan than the diet.
In 1951 the Vegan Society (founded in the UK) added “exclude all forms of animal exploitation” to their definition of veganism. Simohamed Bouhakkaoui of MoroccanVegan explains, “The moral system changes through the ages. In one era, racism and gender discrimination were acceptable in the world, but they changed because of the activism of many people.”
For Moroccan vegans, animal abuse and environmentalism top their reasons to choose abstinence from animal products.
Vegan and green
Bouhakkaoui says veganism is a solid consideration for environmentally conscious people “because their environmental struggle is incomplete as long as you consume meat that harms the environment. Meat accounts for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gas [emissions] from food production and it takes up to 15,500 liters of water to produce 1 kilo of beef.” 
At the vegan restaurant Niya in Casablanca, customers will find a small boutique area that sells “Moroccan brands that promote craftsmanship, zero waste, and creativity,” their website explains. Their selection of lovely items is also “certified cruelty-free.”
How do menstrual panties belong in an eating establishment, one may wonder. Niya owner Chama Tahiri-Ivorra explained to Morocco World News (MWN) that being vegan is an interconnected, far-reaching ethical lifestyle. 
Each consumer purchase has power. Tahiri-Ivorra shops and sells selectively, favoring ethically made products that have a reduced impact on the environment, such as period panties instead of chemical-laden, disposable feminine hygiene products.

In a surprising twist, Tahiri-Ivorra told MWN that even considering the plastics and chemicals that may have been used, she “would rather buy fake leather than have an animal killed for shoes.” She notes, “The violence matters for me.”
Is your meat a ‘good thing’?
In Morocco, local meat is considered halal, meeting the Islamic guidelines to be consumed by Muslims. Among these guidelines is the concept of zabiha, which goes beyond the technicalities of which meats are edible, the actual slaughter, and reciting “Bismillah” before the slaughter. Zabiha addresses the violent nature of taking a life as well as the care in raising animals for food.  
According to both halal and zabiha requirements, animals must not see other animals being slaughtered, they must be killed in a comfortable position, and the slaughter knife must be perfectly sharp. 
Moroccan vegans are painfully aware of a component of zabiha often overlooked in the production of meat and dairy products, even in Morocco. To be zabiha, the animal must live a pleasant life, free from abuse.
Some Moroccan vegans reject meat as a matter of preventing cruelty to animals, while others think beyond that and relate to animals as sentient beings. Tahiri-Ivorra says she is “antispecism,” noting that “every species contributes to the balance” of the world’s ecosystem.
Though veganism is unique in Morocco, for whatever reasons Moroccan choose the lifestyle it is very much in line with some Muslims' spiritual beliefs. 
Bouhakkaoui notes that though he has a handful of reasons for being vegan, ultimately “Islam allowed Muslims to consume meat, but it did not oblige it. We as humans have a choice to make.”
Healthy, satisfying choices
If the vegan diet is healthy is widely debated, but a plant-based and reduced-meat diet is known to be healthy. Moroccan blogger Vegan Hanane says, “In short, you should go vegan for your health, the animals, and the environment.”
A tasty homemade dish via VeganHanane's Instagram.
Among the health benefits that Hanane has found along her vegan journey are “1 Increase in energy, 2 Healthy Weight Management and 3. Improved Digestion: No more smelly farts, bloating, and constipation. When I ate on a high protein diet, I was constipated ALL the time.”
Many believe that a vegan diet is difficult to maintain, boring, and not satisfying. Bouhakkaoui, Tahiri-Ivorra, and Hanane have all faced these hurdles and overcome them. Bouhakkaoui explains, “In Morocco, we can easily make choices. Our country is rich in agricultural products and there are always available alternatives. It's easy to veganize Moroccan meals like couscous, refissa, tajine…”
Niya in Casablanca has a tantalizing and rotating seasonal menu, with “veganized” dishes such as the first vegan burger in Casablanca, as well as original plant-based dishes such as cauliflower in a cashew and coconut sauce. But she was concerned with the challenge of creating “complex, exciting, filling food for nonvegans.”
Tihiri-Ivorra has so far thrived. The 200 reviews her place received on Google include much positive feedback from customers who loved the food even though they are not vegan. Niya’s atmosphere was also repeatedly reviewed as having “great vibes” and even being “immaculate,” demonstrating that peacefulness is the core of veganism.

190,"Nadia Fettah Alaoui, Leading the Moroccan Economy","Celebrated entrepreneur and public servant, Nadia Fettah’s illustrious career features two decades of noteworthy achievements.",Jasper Hamann,"Mar. 11, 2022 3:12 p.m.","Rabat - As part of Morocco World News’ Women’s Award 2022, we look into the profile of Morocco’s inspiring Minister of the Economy, Nadia Fettah Alaoui. 
The first woman to lead one of the country’s most important ministries, Fettah has rapidly made her name in both business and politics. She is a shining example for young women pursuing their ambitions in both the public and private sector. 
Born and raised in Rabat, Nadia Fettah had big shoes to fill from a young age. Expectations were high for the daughter of the late Mohammed Fettah, who served as both Minister of Mines and Energy and Director General of Morocco’s largest company, OCP. Her background meant that hard work and education were valued heavily by her family.
Nadia Fettah completed her high school education at the Dar Essalam school operated by the French Lycée Descartes, before moving to France to study at the prestigious HEC Paris business school in Jouy-en-Josas. 
After graduation, Fettah moved back to Morocco, where she joined the US accounting and consultancy firm Arthur Andersen in Casablanca. The renowned US firm employed Fettah for three years, before she made the first defining move in her career. 
In 2000, Fettah took the risk of starting her own company, Maroc Invest Finances Group, where she would work as both founder and manager for five years. In 2005, she rejoined the corporate structure when she was asked to run the support and finance division of CNIA assurance, which had recently been purchased by Saham Group.
Her name quickly grew within the group, and she was promoted to become the Group’s Deputy CEO of Finance and Mergers and Acquisitions, before  joining Saham Finance as Deputy CEO of Finance & Operations in the following year. She eventually rose to become chair of Saham’s board of directors in Morocco before stepping into politics in 2019.
Fettah had long remained neutral in Moroccan politics, but her exemplary career prompted her candidacy to head Morocco’s important Ministry of Tourism. Following her appointment to the Ministry, she chose to join the National Rally of Independents (RNI), led by former Minister of Agriculture, Aziz Achannouch.
Ever since, Nadia Fettah Alaoui has firmly established her presence among Morocco’s decision-makers. She served admirably as Minister of Tourism during some of the sector’s darkest days amid the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing her into the spotlight of Moroccan politics  in an election that called for political change and economic development.
As a professional uniquely qualified in both business and politics, Fettah was asked to lead one of Morocco’s most important ministries, the Ministry of Economy and Finance. 
Against a highly turbulent economic backdrop, Nadia Fettah Alaoui has become the first woman to lead the Ministry of Economy and Finance, rapidly demonstrating her wisdom and vision for a stronger Moroccan economy. 
Under Fettah’s leadership, the Ministry has introduced a number of key initiatives and policies that focus on rapidly growing foreign direct investment (FDI) in Morocco. Since then, the country has attracted the attention of international investors through noteworthy domestic investment brands such as Morocco Now and Morocco Tech.
Nadia Fettah, who regularly expresses herself in English online, oversaw the gradual prioritization of compelling English-language marketing expressions in the Ministry’s international investment pitches. Her attention to branding, image,  and public events shows a renewed corporate approach to ministry operations since Fettah’s appointment.
Now, Morocco can feel confident it has one of its most talented citizens at the head of the economic ministry. Raised in a home where the joys and pitfalls of politics and business were evident in equal measure, she now faces a tough task that appears well-suited to her unique skillset.
Morocco’s economy currently faces intense pressure due to the geopolitical fallout of the Ukraine conflict, rising food and energy prices, a disrupted global supply chain,  ongoing COVID-19 concerns, and severe drought. On top of managing all this, Fettah is spearheading Morocco’s international FDI pitch, including at the Dubai Expo, while helping to revive the country’s crucial tourism sector.
While the road ahead is difficult, Nadia Fettah Alaoui has shown herself to be more than capable at tackling tough challenges. Given her exemplary track record in both business and politics, Morocco appears to have placed a bright star at the head of its economy.

191,Doors Open for OCP as Ukraine Crisis Pauses Russian Fertilizer Exports,The war in Ukraine has caused a disruption in exports for many key products.,Oussama Aamari,"Mar. 11, 2022 2:52 p.m.","Rabat - As the Ukraine crisis causes a disruption to most exports from Ukraine and Russia, Morocco’s OCP finds itself in an advantageous position as Russia pauses its fertilizer exports.
On Friday, March 4 2022, the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade announced that national fertilizer manufacturers would be temporarily suspending their exports, in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Phosphate prices have already been trending upwards since April 2020, going from $70 (685 MAD) on that date, to a peak of $176 (MAD 1694) in December 2021.
While the halt in Russian exports will definitely cause prices to climb again, this could present an opportunity for Morocco’s OCP to improve its place on the international market.
Russia represents 13% of the world’s trade of intermediate fertilizer material, and 16% of finished fertilizer products. In addition, although it only has 2.5% of the world’s ammonia supply, it accounts for 40% of the world’s ammonium nitrate trade.
Russia and Belarus also supply the world with about 40% of its supply of potash, a key ingredient in fertilizers.
The crisis in Ukraine is unsurprisingly going to be extremely disruptive to the market and global supply chains. Brazil for example imports around 60% of Russian nitrogen fertilizers, and therefore must find alternatives.
Now as this disruption occurs, big American and Chinese producers would have to scale down their production for foreign markets and focus instead on supplying their domestic markets.
As the world’s largest exporter of phosphates and the possessor of the world’s by far largest reserves, Morocco and its state owned OCP group stand to benefit tremendously from the rise in prices of the raw material and fertilizer.
Morocco’s phosphate reserves are estimated to be around 50 billion tons, far ahead of China’s second place at 3.2 billion tons, and comprising more than 70% of the world’s accounted-for reserves.
Fertilizers are also expected to grow faster, with ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate reaching prices of more than 800 euros per metric ton.
The two products represent the OCP’s biggest assets, especially in its export and worldwide business.
Morocco’s state-owned OCP is the world’s largest exporter of crude phosphate, which positions it well to benefit from the rise in prices of the material.
In addition, OCP enjoys a healthy and steadily growing fertilizer business, which has helped it become the key player in the African fertilizer market and even pose serious competition to global giants such as Mosaic, America’s leading manufacturer.

However, the war in Ukraine can also pose obstacles, as rising gas and ammonia prices can make the process of mining and processing phosphates much more difficult and costly.
To this end, OCP has been continuously working to make its operations more efficient and neutralize the rising costs of gas and other operational costs.
Additionally, Russia’s exports of ammonia to Morocco are likely important for OCP’s operations. More than 12% of Russia’s $1.2 billion in exports to Morocco are ammonia shipments.
OCP revenues have already improved over the last year, with the company recording a net revenue of MAD 57 billion ($5.8 billion) in December of 2021, which is a 38% increase from the same time period in 2020, despite COVID-19 leaving world markets and supply chains in a tumultuous state.
The rise in phosphate and fertilizer prices, as well as the suspension of Russian exports, can however lead to an overall negative effect on the world’s agricultural output. If the supply and consumption of fertilizers drop, we could see a drop in agricultural yields, which could affect regions already suffering from food insecurity and see food prices soar.

192,"Salma Bensaid: TV Production Mogul, Queen of Interdisciplinary Success","Since the year 2000, Salma Bensaid has worked on countless TV programs in Morocco.",Oussama Aamari,"Mar. 11, 2022 11:01 a.m.","Rabat - Salma Bensaid has carved a reputation for herself as one of Morocco’s most popular show business names, with several  of her programs – especially “Dar wa Decor” – achieving significant success.
Since 2000, Bensaid has worked in the Moroccan television industry, creating some of the most well-known shows in the country.
Combining this illustrious television career with her passion for home design, and other experiences in fashion and home staging, Bensaid stands as an example of a Moroccan woman who has achieved interdisciplinary success, working in various fields.
An illustrious career
Bensaid started work at an audiovisual production company in 2000, after obtaining a science diploma from high school and a university degree in Commerce and Marketing.
She says her duties as a producer during this time consisted in conceiving of, creating, and selling TV projects to channels. This also entailed working closely with advertisers and companies for branded content ideas.
Bensaid says she allowed her career as a producer to be shaped by connections with other sectors and fields.
In 2006, she launched Della Spiga, a luxury platform to market Italian fashion brands, purchasing collections from fashion shows and opening a boutique in Casablanca.
She recounts collaborating , as part of this project, with various designers and luxury brands such as Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, and Prada, among others.
“Italy became my favorite destination, and an inspiration that accompanied me in my career and the themes of the works I would put out later,” she told La Marocaine.
Having branched off and explored other fields, Bensaid returned to the TV world in 2008 with new ideas linked to lifestyle and design.
In more than 21 years of working in the industry, Bensaid has successfully aired over a dozen TV concepts.
Through works such as “Dari fi Bali” and “Swab w Klam,” one program emerged as the producer’s biggest hit: “Dar wa Decor.”
“Dar wa Decor,” meaning House and Decor in English, became a sensation in Morocco, marryinging the producer and presenter’s expertise in both TV production and interior design.
A love for interior design
Having grown up with a mother who worked in design herself, Bensaid says that she had a passion for the arts since her early childhood, and began making small paintings independently by the age of 8.
That love for the arts extended to her living space, she says, where she regularly made small modifications. This love for interior decorating would blossom with her experience as producer in the show “Dar wa Decor.”
The show entailed visiting Moroccan houses to give a makeover to the interiors of these living spaces. Everything from wall paint, furniture, and decorations could get a facelift on the show.
With a large team of painters, designers, and carpenters, the show would regularly transform houses overnight, delighting homeowners while providing great entertainment for audiences around the country.
Salma says that she continues to be fascinated by decor and change, always looking for new sources of inspiration in Moroccan markets.
Not only that, but the producer's exposition to the motifs and designs prevalent in Italy and Europe has helped her build a style that fuses those cultures with Moroccan traditions.
The houses featured on the program often combine Western minimalist motifs and trends with more traditional and intricate Moroccan artisanry, keeping national heritage and shared traditions alive in the participants’ homes while adding a touch of modernity.
The aesthetic certainly confirms her love for Moroccan artisanry and aesthetics. In fact, the producer’s next concepts for TV shows explicitly focus on the Moroccan cultural side of this equation, she has stated.
It all ties into what Bensaid believes is the key for women’s success in any field: doing what you love.
Citing French writer Stendhal, Bensaid said she believes the secret to the success of anyone, and of women in particular, is choosing a career doing something one loves.
She encourages women in Morocco and elsewhere to think about their personal dreams and what they enjoy doing when thinking about career ambitions, citing that as the key to success.

193,"UM6P Explores Role of Science, Innovation to Ensure Food Security",Scientific research and emerging technologies are a promising solution to enhance the productivity of small farmers and reduce undernourishment worldwide.,Oumaima Latrech,"Mar. 10, 2022 6:54 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) is organizing on March 9 and 10, the 12th edition of the Arbois Round Tables, which features multidisciplinary scientific conferences on the strategic, economic, environmental, and health related issues of food security.
Food security is becoming an alarming issue worldwide that affects vulnerable households in almost every country. The COVID-19 pandemic, which slowed down the global economy and created severe supply chain disruptions, has further exposed more people to food insecurity.
The two-day event focuses on food insecurity as a main issue that holds many nations from achieving sustainable development.
Several international panelists debated over food production, the impact of global warming on agriculture, water, and renewable energies, as well as available agricultural techniques that allow healthier nutrition.
Themed “Feeding the world: the challenges and the limits,” the renowned experts used the first day of the event to highlight the latest scientific advances in their respective fields, to promote innovation and scientific research as means to ensure sustainable agriculture.
Initially held at Aix-Marseille University, this constitutes the first of the Arbois Round Tables to be held in an African country. The conferences encompass a think tank of approximately 40 leading figures in research and development.
“Organizing the 12th edition in Morocco symbolizes the desire of the Arbois Round Tables to open up to an African continent in full scientific, cultural and economic emergence, for which sustainable nutrition remains a major goal for development,” the UM6P said in a statement.
With much more uncertainties identified in times of COVID-19 that lead to severe food insecurity, the UM6P calls for “strengthening communication between the scientific community and the public” in search for answers and solutions based on science.
Sustainable agriculture at the core of UM6P’s research program
In a technology-driven world, research and innovation are becoming an important tool to strengthen agricultural practices aimed at ensuring food sustainability.
The UM6P has put sustainable agriculture at the core of its research and innovation system since the university’s 2017 inauguration by King Mohammed VI.
In his opening speech, UM6P President Hicham El Habti stressed that the global economy is experiencing a surge in the prices of basic food products, with their production being a major challenge to meet the needs of the growing global population.
“Food security is the sinequanone condition for any development model. Besides production, it is necessary to tackle nutrition as well, which can be the most intersectoral development issue that exists as it involves a plethora of ecosystems that are difficult to dissociate from each other,” El Habti said.
With agriculture being a pivotal economic activity that transforms economies to reach several goals such as ensuring food security, it is a key element to improve nutrition.
In his speech, El Habti highlighted commitments by the scientific and international community to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs), recalling the 2020 UN Food Systems Summit and the COP26 summit that took place last year to accelerate innovation to tackle climate change, agriculture, and other persisting challenges.
“Africa's sustainable agriculture features among the central elements of the UM6P research and innovation system,” El Habti noted. He added that UM6P has created laboratories, developed agritech platforms in Morocco, and supported several agricultural startups to strengthen the agricultural ecosystem.
Organizing the Arbois Round Tables testifies to UM6P’s continuous commitment to further boost research, innovation, and international academic cooperation to ensure a strategic sustainable development and improve the agricultural sector in Morocco and across Africa.
In a statement to Morocco World News, UM6P’s president underlined the pivotal role of the university’s experimental farm, in which researchers and students are able to develop innovative fertilizers and technologies while carrying out planting tests.
“Our aim is to share our innovation with farmers in Morocco and beyond. On top of research and development (R&D), we focus on building a close connection with farmers to learn more about their concerns so we can niche our R&D and innovations to respond to their needs,” El Habti added.
Food insecurity and agricultural challenges
A growing world population leads to increased demand for agricultural products.
For Alan Kirman, professor at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) in France, “global finance that was hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the human-made systems on which we rely on such as food supply, global value chains, and health systems.” 
Alongside the farm sector that was severely impacted amid the healthcare crisis, Kirman highlighted that fishing, an alternative source of food, continues to be impacted by global warming.
Climate change has caused the redistribution of marine fish stocks, which has negatively impacted equitable distribution of food provisioning services, he explained.
Of precipitation and water availability, they have witnessed several changes due to planned infrastructure projects such as hydropower in some regions, Kirman noted.
Meanwhile, Roberto Berutti, Member of Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski's Cabinet to the European Commission stressed that the European Union is actively engaged in sustainability and international cooperation.
“Agriculture's missions consist of feeding citizens all over the world and ensuring food security for future generations,” Berutti said.
In a panel “Research and Innovation for new agricultural practices as seen by the EU,” Berutti underlined the necessity to boost collective efforts to ensure the viability for ecological systems for the long term, which agriculture relies on a lot.
The panelists reached a consensus that research and innovation are the available solutions to accelerate progress towards a sustainable and resilient future of agriculture and food, which can also contribute to reducing poverty in many vulnerable countries.

194,Moroccan Tourism Operators: Border Reopening is Not Enough,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic unveiled long-standing structural issues constraining the development of the Moroccan tourism sector, tourism operators argue.",Souad Anouar,"Feb. 08, 2022 10:26 a.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s tourism operators have expressed for years their dissatisfaction with governmental measures to “save” and reform the sector. For them, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has just exposed the long-standing structural issues burdening the advancement of Moroccan tourism. 
The World Health Organization confirmed the then new and strange virus, COVID-19, on January 12, 2020. Yet Morocco was not impacted by it until March 2, 2020, when the country’s Ministry of Health reported the first two COVID-19 cases in the country. 
After the announcement, the authorities imposed a state of emergency and a lockdown limiting mobility and thus the spread of the virus. 
In December 2020, American think tank Brookings estimated a loss of 581,000 jobs in Morocco during the third quarter of 2020, adding that five million workers in the country’s informal economy had by then lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. 
Victims of a never-ending pandemic
Tourism operators, including professionals owning or working at hotels, inns, travel agencies, as well as independent travel agents, consider themselves the main victims of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
With their livelihood depending on people’s mobility, the reinforcement of the lockdown and the state of emergency was particularly devastating news for their economic activities.
To alleviate the impact of the economic fallout of the COVID crisis, King Mohammed VI launched in March 2020 a $1 billion fund to modernize health infrastructure and support social segments heavily impacted by the virus outbreak. 
However, the measures were not enough to save the tourism sector. With “tourism 100% dead,” one of the interviewed hospitality operators told Morocco World News (MWN), workers in the industry were facing a “real crisis,” with “direct” and “immense” impacts.
As the sector generates 7% of the country’s GDP, the lockdown led to a 71% drop in tourist arrivals in 2021 compared to 2019, representing an annual loss of 20 million travelers and MAD 90 billion ($9.59 billion) in foreign exchange profits in 2019-2021 period, the minister of tourism reported in late January 2022. 
In addition to the country’s losses, owners of travel agencies, hotels, and inns have continued to face tremendous charges like water and electricity bills, as well as wages and taxes, among others. With no income, they fell into more debt and felt hopeless, leading some to resort to suicide to end their suffering. 
As they grew increasingly desperate, travel agencies and tourist carriers operators organized sit-ins and protests in front of the Ministry of Tourism in January 2022 to voice their concerns following the implementation of the ministry’s emergency plan.
Over 250 travel agents shouted together “save the sector, open the borders,” travel agency owner Najat Dahhaj told Morocco World News.  In a statement on January 3, the Moroccan National Association of Travel Agencies said Moroccan tourism professionals “feel abandoned to their fate after two years of this suffocating crisis.”
The statement came as disgruntled tourism workers prepared to take to the streets to vent their frustration at the government's decision on November 29, 2021, to extend border closure due to the emergence of the Omicron variant. 
The government had initially announced border closure for two weeks until December 13, leading to the stranding of Moroccan nationals abroad and foreigners within Moroccan territories.

But with authorities now calling for the border closure and travel ban to remain in force until at least the end of January -- and probably beyond, until Morocco felt relatively confident in terms of containing Omicron -- protests for the reopening of borders multiplied across the country. The apparent general public mood of COVID fatigue and deep-seated frustration with border closure led the government to reassure and promise that it would soon lift its COVID travel ban. And with the resumption of international flights on February 7, tourism professionals now maintain that border reopening is no longer the dominant obstacle to the prosperity of the Moroccan tourism sector. 
Mohamed, a travel guide from Tafraout, Tiznit Province, described the border reopening decision as a “band-aid solution,” a quick and temporary fix to more rooted and structural issues pertaining to the informal character of the sector and state negligence. 
What’s in the ministry of tourism’s emergency plan?
In response to growing social distress caused by the pandemic, the minister of tourism, Fatim-Zahra Ammor, introduced a MAD 2 billion ($216 million) emergency plan to rescue the tourism sector and support its professionals. 
The strategy extends MAD 2,000 ($215) compensations and defers National Social Security Fund (CNSS) charges for six months to all employees in the hospitality sector, including tourist carriers and classified restaurants. 
It exempts hoteliers of 2020 and 2021 business taxes and 2021 and 2022 interim interest rates for bank loans. Tourist carriers are also spared of bank interest rates as part of the emergency plan. These measures cover the period of their inactivity as the state will pay the charges. 
Additionally, the government allocated MAD 1 billion ($108 million) to finance hotels’ maintenance, renovation, and training plans preparing them for border reopening. 
The adopted measures resulted from meetings between Ammor, the National Confederation of Tourism (CNT), the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Professional Group of Banks of Morocco (GPBM).
A flawed support system
While the plan seems to have ended the struggle of tourism operators, the majority of them did not benefit from it or were only lucky enough to benefit partially from it. 
The dominance of informal activities in the tourism sector represents a major limitation to the optimal implementation of crisis relief mechanisms such as the emergency plan. 
While informal, undeclared hospitality operators across Morocco are known to local authorities, the informal economy is embraced as a norm. 
The high unemployment rates -- which the European Investment Bank in 2019 recorded at 13.5% for women, 24.9% for youth in general, and 39.2% for urban youth in particular -- demonstrate the need for an inclusive operating economic system.
Additionally, low literacy rates in rural areas represent a major challenge to integrate local youth into the formal economy where reading and writing skills are required as a bare minimum. 
In 2018, Morocco’s National Observatory for Human Development (ONDH) reported that rural adults have, on average, 2.2 years of education. The statistics are shocking but represent the forgotten reality of rural areas. 
The Moroccan government has launched initiatives to address the issue of school dropouts and has encouraged families to educate both their sons and daughters. 
Morocco’s National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) partnered with the Ministry of Education to generalize pre-schooling education and educational supervision as well as build more boarding schools in rural areas in the 2019-2021 academic year.
While these measures are essential to counter illiteracy in the long term, adults currently operating in the informal sector need more support to integrate formal sectors. Recent projects such as Awrach temporarily address such systematic issues.
Informal economy: burden or/and need?
Mohammed, an accredited tour guide for natural spaces, told MWN that illiteracy is one of the obstacles to the training and institutionalization of tour guides in the country. Although faux guides are fluent in several languages such as French, English, and  Spanish, some of them do not know how to write or/and read. 
This represents a challenge for qualified faux guides seeking to take the state-designed written test required for accreditation. 
As a former faux guide himself, Mohammed reported that most accredited guides operating across the country went through a phase of training as faux guides. Thus, state accreditation is not the only measure to evaluate the competencies of the tour guides. 
Mohammed added that the accredited and non-accredited tour guides can work together to meet the regular high demand by mostly foreign tourists.  
He gave the example of an initiative launched in Imlil, Al Haouz province, that organizes the activities of both groups to meet touristic needs in the region. Non-accredited guides accompany the accredited tour guides and benefit from in-field training. 
As faux guides are dominating the sector, the ministry should provide appropriate training for them, incorporate additional options for accreditation tests, and organize their activities to ensure equal opportunities for all tour guides across the country, Mohammed argued.

The left behind
The new emergency plan benefitted legally protected professionals in travel agencies, hotels, inns, tour guides, among other operators. 
Only professionals registered at the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) before February 2020 have received the MAD 2000 compensation, leaving new operators excluded from any governmental support. Najat Dahhaj and 30 other travel agency owners in her surroundings missed the deadline by a few days. 
New travel agencies have to request licensing from the ministry of tourism to start operating and registering in CNSS. As Najat’s provisional license came out in March 2020, she and her employees were not eligible to receive state support based on the program’s criteria. 
Furthermore, non-classified inns and small-scale hotels did not benefit from the state support for taxes and bank interest rates exemption. “Only three, four, and five-star hotels” profited from the social fund, Mohammed told MWN.  
Majid Barouch, a hotel owner in Tafraout and Secretary-General of Tafraout tourism association, confirmed Mohammed's assessment. He said that his 16-rooms hotel did not receive additional funds besides the MAD 2000 compensation.  
For him, too, the compensation is “not enough to meet the expenses of rent, living costs, etc.” Due to the devastating economic fallout of the pandemic, he decided to downsize the staff from nine to four employees including the manager; he also cut salaries by 50%. 
In addition to small hotels, only inn owners and employees registered with CNSS before February 2020 received the MAD 2000 compensation, the only support offered to them.
Bassou, an inn owner in Imilchil, Midelt province, reported to MWN that mountain tourism stopped in the country due to the COVID lockdown. Naturally, this led to the annulment of thousands of reservations. On top of the colossal financial losses Imlilchil tourism workers suffered, Bassou said he and four other registered inn owners in Imilchil had to pay taxes and other expenses. 
He also noted that inns in Midelt province are not classified by the ministry of tourism. Some of them have operated in the region for years but are not recognized by the ministry. As a result, 12 of the inns in the region do not pay taxes while only five do in the form of personal income taxes or limited liability company (SARL) taxes. 
The absence of classification and follow-up by the Ministry of Tourism reflects the unstructured nature of the Moroccan tourism industry in certain regions and sectors. 
Although the Imilchil region was severely hit by the pandemic, its economy witnessed a gradual revival after the government allowed inter-cities and inter-regional mobility; but it has not yet returned to normal.

Morocco’s National Tourism Office (ONMT) launched three ‘Ntla9awFbladna’ (let’s meet in our country) campaigns to promote domestic tourism amid border closure. The campaign helped some regions such as Imilchil -- originally a favorite destination for European tourists -- to gain a new clientele base: Moroccans. 
But domestic tourism does not generate enough income for professionals in the sector, Majid stated, adding that this type of tourism is exercised over a short period of time such as holidays or weekends with a limited and low budget.
Like tourism professionals, Moroccans in all economic sectors were hit by the COVID-19 crisis, making them look for cheap options while traveling. 
This phenomenon could be explained by the considerable drop in the Moroccan purchasing power and the rise in poverty rates in the country over the past two years. 
According to the World Bank's latest data, the Moroccan purchasing power parity (PPP) decreased by $560 between 2019 and 2020, while the percentage of “vulnerable” population categories ($5.5 PPP) reached 26.7% in 2021 and is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. 
Normalizing COVID?
The news Moroccan operators have been anxiously waiting for came yesterday, February 7, as Morocco welcomed its first travelers after almost three months of flight ban. But could one day reverse cumulative losses of two years? 
The obvious answer is no. As Morocco continues to record thousands of new COVID cases and dozens of deaths weekly, the country might still not be considered a safe travel destination for some tourists fearing COVID-19 infection. However, with the normalization of the virus in several European countries -- and beyond -- there is a hope to gradually revive the North African country’s tourism industry. 
Some professionals in the sector strongly oppose the government-imposed requirements to enter Morocco. Majid said that the requirements convey a “don’t come” message to tourists. He also called for the adoption of the European approach to COVID-19 -- seeing it as a “seasonal flu.”
Per the Moroccan government’s list of requirements for travelers wishing to enter Morocco, passengers are obliged to present a vaccination pass and a negative PCR test taken less than 48 hours before plane boarding. 
The travelers will also take rapid tests upon arrival and might be subject to random PCR tests. Positive cases will have to be confined at the place of their residency. 
While the government argues that the measures are “necessary,” tourism professionals consider them to be harsh and uncalled for. 
Additionally, the operators collectively recall tourists’ doubts about coming to Morocco as governmental decisions provide little time for preparation in case of border closure. 
Many tourists were stuck in Morocco after the government announced the country’s first lockdown in March 2020. As an act of support in those first weeks of COVID panic, hotel owners in Merzouga hosted stranded tourists free of charge.
Similarly, after the sudden border closure in November 2021, Moroccan nationals abroad and foreign tourists in Morocco had no way to return home. To address the issue, Morocco launched the “Maakoum” (with you) operation to repatriate Moroccans stranded in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 
Moroccan and foreign authorities have since succeeded in organizing several operations to help repatriate Moroccans abroad and foreigners in Morocco. Yet the experience, especially Morocco’s sudden and last-minute decisions to close its borders, made some tourists lose trust in the North African kingdom, according to interviewed tourism operators.
As the future is uncertain and the governmental decisions are unpredictable, tourists might abstain from visiting the kingdom for a long time, they argued. 
With Morocco being out of the international tourism market for almost two years, the country is “left behind” compared to countries that remained open to tourists such as Spain, Greece, Egypt, Peru, and Indonesia, tourism operators concluded. 
If Morocco learned anything in the past two years, it would be that it is hard to predict developments with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The border reopening decision provides hope for a gradual return to normal. 
However, the interviewed operators appeared to suggest, the future of the tourism sector will remain uncertain unless the government approaches the virus as a regular seasonal flu and launches structural projects to create an inclusive Moroccan economy aligned with the objectives of the country’s much-touted New Development Model.

195,Al Moutmir: OCP Group’s Business Model to Contribute to a Sustainable Agriculture,"Al Moutmir is an expertise-sharing Business Model in the field of sustainable and smart agriculture, with a focus on boosting small farmers’ income while reducing their production costs.",Oumaima Latrech,"Feb. 07, 2022 10:00 a.m.","Rabat - OCP Group, a world-leading fertilizer company and the world’s largest phosphate mining company, is pursuing its commitment to improve the agricultural value chain in Morocco and across Africa through the Al Moutmir initiative.
Launched in 2018, the outreach initiative focuses on farmers as real agents of change to ensure sustainable agriculture and food systems by assisting and providing farmers, cooperatives, and agri-entrepreneurs with solutions that enable them to expand their production growth.
As several climate-related challenges continue to impact farmers’  productivity, Al Moutmir initiative aims at empowering rural farmers and cooperatives to boost the agricultural ecosystem in Morocco.
Sustainable management of Morocco’s agriculture
The initiative, has so far supported directly more than 50,000 farmers across the country in increasing their productivity in a sustainable way, and over 300,000 farmers via the mobile application @tmar. 
@tmar is the first application for nationwide extension services; it has been offering its services since 2019 with an aim to support local farmers and make scientific information available to all and for free.
Free of charge, the application provides farmers with more insights and facilitates decision-making regarding their agricultural activity, particularly on the technical, agronomic, and economic aspects. 
Morocco World News spoke to Fatiha Charradi, Vice-President in charge of agricultural development at OCP Group, who underlined that the group’s engineers are deployed in several provinces to work hand in hand with local farmers.
Of Al Moutmir’s philosophy of ensuring the sustainability of Morocco’s agricultural sector, Charradi said that the program relies on the scientific approach as a key driver of prosperous and sustainable productivity.
The program also operates based on a participatory and inclusive approach that connects communities in order to implement customized solutions with and for the ecosystem.
“[ OCP continuously stimulates the innovation loop with the various stakeholders to respond with agility to the challenges of the ecosystem and bring out new solutions, adapted and affordable to all,” Charradi explained.
The initiative’s approach also focuses on supporting farmers through integrated capacity-building programs to become “agri-preneurs” and consider agriculture as a real business from which they can make profitable benefits.
OCP Group “believes that achieving sustainable agriculture and food security involves investment in innovation and new technologies,” Charradi noted.
In this sense, she highlighted that OCP Al Moutmir deploys technological and innovative tools that contribute to increasing the quantity of food produced while optimizing the inputs needed to make agriculture more productive and sustainable.
OCP began fertilizer production in the 1960s, and the company’s dominance in the African market and increasing global outreach in recent years have played a decisive role in Morocco ranking in the top 5 fertilizer exporters worldwide. 
When asked about the pivotal role of the scientific research applied in the program to ensure the sustainability of investments, Charradi emphasized that the adoption of such an approach in farming “allows an efficient management of the farm and of the natural resources available.”
With reasoned fertilization being a lever for the development of the agriculture sector, she stressed, “the use of adapted and customized fertilizers has enabled farmers to achieve a significant improvement not only in terms of productivity but also in the quality of their agricultural production.”
Al Moutmir insights
Al Moutmir demonstration platforms saw an increase of 25% of yield in cereals, 27% for olive trees, and 37% for vegetables and other crops.
The scientific-technical itinerary adopted in the demonstration platforms, Charradi noted that it “enabled the efficient management of irrigation water, thanks to the management of irrigation according to the needs of the crops and the particularities of each plot.”
Meanwhile, the customized NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) formulas recorded +21% of yield in cereals, +25% of yield in pulses, +20% of yield in Olive trees.
As for the no-till program, it witnessed +18% of yield improvement, enabling farmers to reduce their costs of production and gain on average more than MAD 1,300 ($138) per hectare while improving their net margins by over 55.4%. 
The no-till farming is an agricultural technique for growing crops or pasture without disturbing the soil through tillage. The technique is designed to enable farmers to test their soil and understand the crops before farming.
“Thanks to digital tools like the mobile Application @tmar, Agripedia, and the Smart Blender, farmers managed to simulate their farming income at the beginning of each agricultural season,” Charradi added.
The Smart Blender technology consists in manufacturing Blend NPK formulas for each agricultural plot based on its own soil testing results. 
With the program model being mainly oriented toward small-scale farmers, OCP’s mission is to help them maintain and increase their income by providing them with innovative tools and solutions to boost their production capacity while reducing their farming costs.
According to statistics stressed by Charradi, farmers improved their yearly net margin by +36% moving, from MAD 5,459 ($582)/ha to MAD 7,472  ($796)/ha for cereals; by +32% for pulses, jumping from MAD 3,680  ($392) per hectare to MAD 4,850 ($517)/ha; and by +32 % for olives, showing a price increase from MAD 9,300 ($991)/ha to MAD 12,250 ($1306)/ha. 
UM6P’s support to OCP Al Moutmir 
Founded on the promotion of training, applied research, and innovation for the benefit of Morocco and Africa, the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) of Benguerir supports Al Moutmir teams and the entire agricultural ecosystem in Morocco and more broadly in Africa. 
The University’s tech-driven methods for education provide operational support to Al Moutmir participants by letting them benefit from several infrastructures: soil testing laboratories, experimental farms, innovation platforms, incubators, and many other levers. 
UM6P also mobilizes national and international agronomy experts who provide their knowledge and scientific support to the teams, with the objective of addressing the agricultural challenges and contributing to the emergence of inclusive agricultural development models that create sustainable value and impact. 
“Al Moutmir is for sure a business use case for OCP, but it is also and above all a use case supported by the vast scientific community interested in the development of the agricultural sector in Africa,” vice-president Charradi underlined.
OCP-Al Moutmir has also forged partnerships with agribusiness professionals, enabling farmers to expand their products to bigger and international markets as well. 
With its different partners, Al Moutmir will launch T@swiq, a mobile application for selling and buying agricultural products while reducing logistic costs and increasing farmers’ profit margins.
 “Beyond the direct community of farmers we are working with, our ambition is to work hand in hand with the ecosystem to support the 1.5 million farmers across the Kingdom [of Morocco] to enable them to increase their yields, their annual income, and live with dignity from agriculture,” she added.
Future challenges
Water scarcity, shrinking land size, and climate change are more worrying than ever for African countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation.
Charradi underlined that beyond those problems, there is also “a lack of local coordination on the use of the most suitable crops for each farm and for each agroclimatic zone along with the product commercialization prior to any cropping.”
When asked about how Al Moutmir aims to tackle such persisting challenges to ensure sustainable development, she outlined that OCP works alongside its many partners to harness the power of digital technologies to intensify innovative initiatives with high potential for impact in food and farming.
As a true accelerator of development, the program’s digital technology helps transform solutions into meaningful services, easily accessible to all and for free, she suggested.
""At OCP Al Moutmir, we strongly believe that innovation and technology are key levers to overcome the gap in the sector and support its transformation,” Charradi said, noting that their initiatives are all driven by the “low tech for high impact” motto.
Low technology, Charradi explained, means taking the best of what has been developed so far, and adapting it to the African socio-economic context while making sure it will deliver economically viable and socially acceptable solutions. 
As such, OCP Group’s Al Moutmir program is an integral part of the Moroccan company’s commitment to the development of the agricultural ecosystem in Morocco and Africa, by deploying different technologies, tools, and approaches to empower rural farmers and cooperatives and inspire African youth.
“African development needs its own models that suit us and answer our real needs,” Charradi stressed.

In his analysis for the US-based Middle East Institute, Tanchum outlines the importance of rapid action to develop Morocco’s fertilizer industry in a sustainable manner.
Morocco’s importance
In his analysis, Tanchum describes the meteoric rise of Morocco’s phosphate and phosphate-based fertilizer industry. 
Morocco possesses over 70% of the world’s phosphate rock reserves, an irreplaceable ingredient in the fertilizers that feed our massive -- and growing -- global population. Tanchum describes the importance of Morocco’s transition from exporting raw materials to producing value-added products domestically.
Yet, Tanchum highlights that “after spending the previous decade transforming its fertilizer manufacturing sector into a global industry leader, Morocco now faces new challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the severe supply chain disruptions that have followed in its wake.”
In a context of a global supply chain crisis, record food prices and growing food insecurity and hunger in Africa and beyond, Morocco’s importance is on the rise. “If Morocco can succeed in helping to stem the rising tide of hunger in Africa, it will become one of the principal geopolitical actors on the continent,” Tanchum highlights.
Challenges ahead
Yet amid the promising forecasts of Morocco’s growing international clout based on its cherished resources, the country finds itself facing significant challenges. 
Morocco is one the frontline of countries set to feel the devastating impact of the growing climate crisis, while the country’s current water and energy needs are already barely met. Producing Morocco’s most-wanted product, phosphate-based fertilizer, has significant energy and water demands that could drain already limited resources in Morocco.
Tanchum describes such a situation as a vicious cycle, where the demand for fertilizers increases the demand for water and energy, leaving locals with little. Morocco’s phosphate industry already consumes 7% of the country’s energy, and 1% of all its water. 
This vicious cycle could be worsened by the fact that Morocco depends on foreign imports to produce nitrogen, an important ingredient in fertilizers whose production requires natural gas. 
Yet, Morocco has the ability to turn this potential vicious cycle into a virtuous one. By prioritizing its green energy initiatives, Morocco can expand its water and energy resources that in turn will help fuel a growing phosphate industry while having ample reserves for citizens and domestic agriculture.
“The future of Morocco's role as a gatekeeper of global food supply chains will ultimately depend on its success at home in achieving energy transition to increase the sustainability of its fertilizer industry,” Tanchum analyzes.
Moroccan solutions
Morocco’s largest company, state-owned phosphate and fertilizer giant OCP Group, is already leading the way when it comes to addressing some of the African continent's food security issues. Tanchum describes the rapid expansion of joint ventures in key African markets. These include vast fertilizer plants in gas-rich Nigeria and Ghana in West Africa. 
In East Africa, OCP is building a massive fertilizer plant in Ethiopia, allowing for both eastern and western Africa to benefit from Moroccan phosphate riches, through joint ventures that take advantage of these nations’ hydrocarbon riches. Through this exemplary south-south cooperation, Morocco gains access to much-needed natural gas, while strengthening African food security and boosting Moroccan regional soft power.
“The success of OCP Africa's holistic approach demonstrates both the centrality of fertilizer to food security and the necessity of enhancing local participation in value chains for fertilizer manufacturing and food production,” emphasizes Tanchum. 
OCP Africa has already achieved remarkable results across Africa. Through the sharing of knowledge and technology, providing fertilizers tailored for specific soil types in Africa, and making mutually beneficial agreements, OCP has boosted agricultural yields in the countries where it operates.
Sustainable Morocco
Despite Morocco’s success in the region, much of its potential depends on the policy path the country takes in terms of domestic energy and water production. Tanchum highlights some of OCP’s ambitious sustainability targets, that seek to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, and have full energy independence by 2030 through renewable energy.
He additionally describes in detail how a sustainable future for Morocco requires massive investment in the country, by the Moroccan government, and foreign partners. 
Morocco can wean itself off its reliance on foreign natural gas by producing green ammonia based on green hydrogen, made using only renewable energy. The country can also supply itself with plentiful water through desalination plants and smart irrigation systems. Yet these ambitions require rapid action, in Morocco and abroad. 
Morocco’s energy production needs to be scaled up in a massive way, according to Tanchum. Moroccan green energy needs to not only fuel the country, it is needed to run a vast network of desalination plants, green hydrogen plants, as well as phosphate and fertilizer production facilities.
According to Tanchum’s research, “how Morocco performs its role as a gatekeeper of global food supply chains will ultimately depend on its success in achieving energy transition through the expansion of its renewable energy sector.”
Such an expansion requires foreign investment, and Tanchum expects foreign countries to line up to invest in, and strengthen ties with, Morocco. “Such investments provide the United States and Europe an opportunity to raise the level of their strategic engagement with Morocco,” Tanchum writes. He adds the ominous warning that “in the absence of such engagement, Morocco will partner with other regional and global actors, shifting the geopolitics of global food security.”

197,#SaveRayane Sparks Discussion Around Well Drilling Regulations in Morocco,"Morocco’s efforts to rescue Rayane are ongoing, with Moroccans and non-Moroccans alike waiting with bated breath to receive positive updates.",Safaa Kasraoui,"Feb. 04, 2022 3:57 p.m.","Rabat - As rescue operations are ongoing in Tamorot, in Morocco’s Chefchaouen, many Moroccans are waiting with bated breath to learn more updates about the case of a five-year-old boy trapped in a narrowed well since February 1.
The rescue operations have entered the third day, with heavy machinery equipment digging near the 32-meter hole to find a way out and save Rayane’s life.
The case of the little boy has shifted from local news to international headlines. Many people across the world are sharing hashtags and supportive messages not only to Rayane’s family but also to members of the civil protection services.
Amid an outpouring of support and solidarity, questions on wells and risks that such infrastructures pose to children and adults are also among the concerns of Moroccans observing the situation. 
The ongoing rescue operation is at the top of people’s minds who continue to discuss the topic at breakfast or while watching televised or online updates about Rayane’s case.
Like any other country, well-drilling operations in Morocco can only legally be conducted in line with legal procedures.
However, many if not hundreds of local reports have highlighted the building or construction of wells or water holes without taking into account proper safety measures.
According to Morocco’s judiciary, the drilling and finishing work on wells and holes has to take place by taking into account legal regulations and requirements.
Morocco’s law emphasized that the required documents include a request from the party seeking to drill a well or a hole. The specifications stipulate that the applicant also has to present a document approving that he or she has the right to use the lands that will host the infrastructure.
The document also has to include a design showing waterpoints.
Parties seeking to drill wells need to file their applications to the water basin agency or the directorate in charge of water management in the region or province they live in.
          View this post on Instagram
                      A post shared by Morocco World News (@moroccoworldnews)
The deadline needed to carry out the legal procedure is 40 days.
Fees people pay to complete the application to water basins in accordance with the board of directors range between MAD 400 and MAD 1,000.
Who shares responsibility?
While information about the legal procedures to drill wells and holes seem to be available online, the reality of people drilling such infrastructure without permission remains prevalent.
Several reports have put the spotlight on the situation of the drilling of wells operating without permission across the country.
Last year in April, locals in a town in the Taroudant province filed a complaint about the drilling of a well without permission.
The complaint was against a local who drilled the well, with complainants accusing him of exploiting water that many residents use.
In the Souss-Massa region, citizens in the Ait Chtouka Baha also filed complaints against investors in the agriculture sector who drilled wells for irrigation without any permission. The locals warned that such drilling could drain the water infrastructure in the region.
While information is lacking about the details of the well, concerns regarding the dangers posed by water holes, such as the hole Rayane is trapped in, are emerging.
A source told Morocco World News that the well belongs to Rayane’s father’s side of the family. Rayane fell in the well while he was playing around the hole.
The Moroccan penal code stipulates that drilling wells without permission can lead to prison sentences for wrongful deaths and fees.
Prison sentences can reach up to five years.
Moroccan lawyer Mohammed Almou told MWN in a statement that both local authorities and Rayane’s father share responsibility in the case.
“Deserted or illegal wells and holes pose a real threat to people's safety. This is the major point that should be discussed and addressed overall. The current case of Rayane is not the first of its kind. I witnessed a similar case in Khmisset in 2008,” the lawyer said.
Almou argued that anyone who committed an act of omission shares the responsibility, including the father.
It is necessary for anyone to mark the hole with cautionary signs to alert people of the danger they could face, the lawyer said stressing that “Anyone who commits an act or omission should be held accountable for endangering somebody’s else life.”
For the lawyer, public authorities also have to be more vigilant and put in place proactive measures to protect citizens’ lives, including children who are more likely to be in danger.
“The authorities should detect all holes, wells, or any other infrastructure issues that could endanger people’s lives. Authorities should also put in place firm and strict measures against anyone who violates the law,” he said.
Bouchra Abdou, a Moroccan human rights activist shared the same sentiment, emphasizing the urgency to tackle such fragile infrastructure.
Abdou, who is the president of the Association Tahhadi for Equality and Citizenship, told MWN that social networks and media played a substantial role to put the spotlight not only on Rayane’s case but also on the infrastructure issues that plagues some towns and major cities.
The family of the child, as well as local authorities who secure seats in communes and provinces both share responsibility, Abdou said.
She emphasized that similar cases happen repeatedly across the country, particularly in smaller towns.
“Authorities have to set up monitoring committees to supervise similar infrastructures that can hurt not only children but also elderly and adults.”
A similar debate has previously emerged after the death of miners in illegal mining wells in the province of Jerada in eastern Morocco. .
In December 2017, the death of two miners in the region made headlines. Another similar incident took place a year later in November 2018 after a 25-year-old man died in a mine collapse.
In 2019, the Moroccan government announced that authorities closed 2,000 abandoned and illicitly exploited shafts in Jerada.
The government vowed to close more shafts throughout the years.
Divided opinions on civil protection efforts
The debate about the efforts and capacity the country has deployed to save Rayan has divided public opinion.
While some criticize the government efforts, others feel support and solidarity for professionals and volunteers deployed in the region is necessary at such a critical time.
“As I am watching the updates on the rescue operation of Rayane near Chefchaouen, I noticed that a lot of people share sarcasm about the efforts made by civil protection, topographers, and local authorities. Those people do not know and are not aware of how the operation is hard. It is easy to express your opinions but it is hard for everyone engaged in the situation,” one Facebook user said.
Citizens and international observers are using the hashtag #SaveRayan on all major social media platforms. Others are sending encouraging messages to civil protection services and local authorities, who have been deployed in the region for drilling work since February 2.
Another Facebook user also paid tribute to all people, including Royal Gendarmerie and topographers, as well as the volunteers who are working without rest to rescue Rayane.
British ambassador to Morocco Simon Martin similarly expressed support for the emergency services who are working “so bravely” to rescue the little boy.
Other internet users and media shared their compassion with families and responded to critics by emphasizing that other country’s emergency services similarly face challenges during rescue operations across the world.
Celebrities, such as football stars such as Achraf Hakimi, Riyadh Mehrez, Herve Renard, and Yassine Bounou, have all expressed support for Rayane’s case.
Other international artists, including  Lebanese star Wael Jassar, have all expressed support and solidarity with the family of Rayane on their social media accounts.

198,OCP’s African Dominance Makes Morocco A Global Leader in Food Security,OCP’s consistent growth has transformed Morocco into a global gatekeeper of the world’s food supply.,Oussama Aamari,"Jan. 31, 2022 1:33 p.m.","Rabat - Possessing over 70% of the world’s phosphate rock supplies, Morocco has long occupied a unique and significantly advantageous position in the world’s agricultural scene.
A recent report by Michael Tanchum for the Middle East Institute details Morocco’s growing gains in Africa owing to the OCP and the future that Morocco has as a global gatekeeper of the world’s food supply.
Nevertheless, Morocco is now facing a new set of challenges in its quest to extend its influence and maintain OCP’s global leadership position.
A global leader
Today, Morocco sits in the top 5 global fertilizer exporters, holding a firm footing even against global manufacturing giants like the United States. This rise was in no small part thanks to the country’s OCP Group, as the report explains.
Tuncham details the OCP’s history, which started as a mining company for phosphates, and eventually delved into other ventures, mainly fertilizer production in the 1960s.
Throughout the following decades, Morocco has worked on transforming the OCP Group into a well-oiled machine, and improving its output through various infrastructure build-ups and manufacturing improvements, he recounts.
This transformation was strengthened by a reconstruction of the company in 2008, which transformed it into the state-owned OCP Group.
“The restructuring and accompanying massive infrastructure build-up transformed OCP into a global leader in all phases of the fertilizer manufacturing value chain,” Tanchum says, “the centerpiece of its transformation was the construction of the world's largest fertilizer production hub in Jorf Lasfar on Morocco's Atlantic coast.”
OCP’s growth is not showing any signs of slowing either. In 2021, the group reported a net revenue of over MAD 57 billion ($6 billion), marking an increase of 38% from the same period in 2020.
The group’s success can be seen globally, as it dominates African markets with a 54% market share. OCP’s market shares in Europe and South America also surpass 40%, positioning the company as a strong player in those regions, the report details.
Even in the United States, which had been historically dominated by the fertilizer giant Mosaic, Tuncham details how OCP occupies a not insignificant 28% of the market, accounting for 60% of imported fertilizers in the country.

The OCP Group’s rise as a global leader certainly also showed an impact on Morocco’s domestic economy, he explains.
The group occupies an important place in Morocco’s economy as the country’s largest employer with over 21,000 employees. And the group also plays an important role for Rabat as a soft power instrument.
OCP in Africa
The Moroccan group dominates the African fertilizer market, with over 50% of the market belonging to it. This dominance is further bolstered by Africa possessing over 60% of the world’s arable land, and over half of its citizens being employed in the agricultural sector, the MEI’s report explains.
Clearly aware of the significant advantages that further expansion into Africa can bring to the group, OCP launched its OCP Africa division in 2016 with subsidiaries in 12 African countries, such as Nigeria and Ethiopia.
OCP has also adopted an approach of direct assistance to smaller farms and farmers. The company’s African division in particular has launched various programs to help local farmers to better participate in the global value chain, Tuncham reports.
The group also launched its “Agribooster” program to “provide farmers with support for every aspect of the agricultural value chain,” according to the OCP.
The program focuses on educating and training small farmers with specialized services and equipment, with the goal of increasing yields and incomes.
In addition to that focal point, the program also helps African farmers by connecting them to insurance providers, international buyers, mechanics, and other institutions that can help them maximize their output, the report explains.
“The success of OCP Africa's holistic approach demonstrates both the centrality of fertilizer to food security and the necessity of enhancing local participation in value chains for fertilizer manufacturing and food production,” Tanchum says
The program has created an additional yield of 33% across the board and has helped more than 600,000 farmers across the countries that it had expanded to, according to figures from OCP. These countries include some of Africa’s largest economies, such as Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, and Senegal.
Corresponding to OCP’s increasing influence in the continent, various African countries saw considerable yield increases for various crops. Tanchum reports increases of over 60% in millet harvests in Senegal for example, and a 48% increase in corn harvests in Nigeria.
OCP’s presence in Nigeria can prove especially useful, according to the report.
“Since Morocco lacks sufficient gas resources of its own, Nigeria can provide the natural gas from which fertilizer's other fundamental component, nitrogen, is produced, commonly in the form of ammonia,” the report details.
The Moroccan giant supplies Nigeria with over 90% of its fertilizer demands, according to industry figures.
For him, OCP’s success in Africa highlights the centrality of the fertilizer industry in agriculture.
“Morocco's centrality to global food security rests with the fact that all food crops, indeed all plant life, require the element phosphorus to grow and Morocco possesses over 70% of the world's phosphate rock reserves, from which the phosphorus used in fertilizers is derived,” he argues.
The huge importance of the fertilizer business in the grand picture of both Africa’s agriculture industry and global food security, is poised to position Morocco as an essential player in global food security, according to Tanchum.
OCP Group’s growth in the continent is not showing any signs of slowing either, with the Moroccan company increasingly keen to capitalize on its current continental dominance  to further improve its outputs. 
OCP Africa put MAD 13 billion ($1.4 billion) towards the construction of an ammonia and fertilizer plant in Nigeria, and there are reports of similar projects with many other governments across the continent.
For example, Tanchum says the group is betting a similar amount into an industrial fertilizer complex in Ghana, taking advantage of Ghana’s natural gas reserves to produce ammonia, among other useful chemicals.
With such a growing influence in agriculture- or food security-related discussions in Africa, Morocco has also managed to expand its soft power in the continent. This is perhaps evidenced by the significant diplomatic gains that the country has made on the Western Sahara question.
Since Morocco rejoined the African Union in 2017, 20 African countries have opened consulates and diplomatic facilities in Morocco’s southern provinces, which further supports Morocco’s sovereignty over the region.
Future challenges
Morocco -- and OCP -- is currently in a crucial period that will determine if its position on the global stage will continue to rise, as is the case with various international giants.
In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic repercussions, along with climate change and green energy concerns, are expected to pose the biggest challenges for OCP Group.
The world is at a critical forkroad when it comes to global food security, as the COVID pandemic caused food prices to rise exponentially worldwide.  The poorest regions and countries in the global south were unsurprisingly the most affected by this spike in food prices, but the global price crisis also put the spotlight on Morocco as a central player in ensuring food security going forward.
Should Morocco manage to make its Africa fertilizer plants a success, it can become one of the largest geopolitical players on the continent by stemming this recent rise in world hunger, Tanchum argues.
“The future of Morocco's role as a gatekeeper of global food supply chains will ultimately depend on its success at home in achieving energy transition to increase the sustainability of its fertilizer industry,” his report says.
Another asset that can undoubtedly be used in this regard would be Morocco’s extensive clean energy resources.
The kingdom is a regional and global leader when it comes to renewables: Morocco pledged earlier this year to reach 80% of renewable energy use by 2050.
Tanchum details, in this regard, how renewable energy can be used to improve the manufacturing and global production processes for OCP’s fertilizers, by using green hydrogen as an input to manufacture green ammonia.
OCP has already been making progress on this front:the company covered 89% of its energy needs with renewables in 2020, and aims to reach 100% in 2030.
The transition to green resources could make OCP’s production cycle more efficient, and bolster Morocco’s place globally as a central player in agricultural production cycles.

199,12 Easy Hacks Guaranteed to Make You Feel Better Everyday,Most resolutions end up feeling tedious or unattainable. Here are 12 simple ways to help you feel better before tackling any resolutions.,Souad Anouar,"Jan. 29, 2022 9:44 a.m.",
200,Moroccan Tourism Workers Speak of Suffering Due to Border Closures,"“People are literally left with nothing,” explains hotelier Karim Riah as he struggles to continue supporting his family and employees in the wake of the border closures.",Brooke Benoit,"Jan. 28, 2022 5:40 p.m.","Agadir - As Morocco celebrates the return of international travel, workers in tourism continue to feel the loss of regular revenue for two years. It will be a slow and difficult crawl out of debt and return to business as usual for the untold millions of people who serve in Morocco’s tourism industry.
From the outside, Karim Riah’s family business, World of Waves Surfhouse in Taghazout, looks like a healthy business with a handful of customers sipping beverages on their patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Above Riah’s restaurant is a hotel serving mostly the surfers and yoga enthusiasts who normally flock to the coastal city. The hotel is open, though they have admitted only one guest at the end of January, which is the high season for surfing.
National Geographic named Taghazout among the “Best Adventure Destinations to Visit in 2022” but currently the village is extraordinarily quiet with uncountable storefronts closed. Riah explained to Morocco World News how the entire village has been devastated by the border closures.
The effects of a complete halt to international tourism has affected not just businesses directly working in the sector. Riah says “it is not just hotels and restaurants” that are hard hit. Businesses that survive on “tourism-related revenues” have closed. “For example… the guys who sell meat, the guys who sell vegetables, the guys who sell carpets, the guys who have camels… even the haircut shops, all the services because, in fact, the whole village has been built around the business of tourism.”
Riah describes how from his perspective, closing the borders to manage Morocco’s epidemic is “a complete disaster.” Riah says that in Morocco “we do not see the point in closing the borders.”
Just as the virus is circulating all around the world and in countries that did not close borders “the virus is circulating here as much as Europe… everyone around us has gotten sick. So it doesn’t make any sense to close the borders and think we are protected by that. We are literally only one of a few countries in the world doing this.”
Moroccan doctor and researcher in health policies and systems Tayeb Hamdi made similar statements in a Facebook post. He addressed that fully vaccinated travelers with a negative PCR certificate are “less risky epidemiologically” than people in Morocco who are not following preventive guidelines. Life goes on with children returned to school and those with jobs continuing to work, paid or not. 
Because Riah’s restaurant remained open during the pandemic and border closures “people think we are really successful. This is really funny,” Riah huffs at the myth. On a Thursday night, which is usually very busy for the restaurant, they have two guests. “Why are we open? We have no choice. If we are closed we lose even more money than if we are open.”
Like most businesses in the tourism sector, Riah has fixed costs that he must continue to pay with or without clients or else he will lose his business and be left with nothing. “We have to pay rent, pay credits to the banks, and salaries. We have more than 20 people working and we don’t want to fire them. We don’t want to fire the people who helped us make this project successful.”
Another myth Riah addresses is regarding government aid. His business is not receiving aid from the Moroccan government. 
Even though his family’s business serves almost entirely tourists he says, “We are not classified by the tourism ministry to get any subsidies.” Their classification as a restaurant outside of Agadir city leaves them and their employees without any help from the government. 
Far too many people are left out of the aid the Moroccan government has earmarked for the tourism industry.

World of Waves Surfhouse, Taghazout
Those left behind
Some of those excluded from subsidized help staged a nationwide sit-in organized in Marrakech, Agadir, Tangier, Laayoune, Dakhla, Casablanca, and other cities. The union office of restaurants and coffee shops, the association of taxi drivers, the organization of tourist transport, and travel agencies were among those protesting exclusions from the emergency plan for tourism.
Riah notes that even though the subsidies are a “nice help” for those who receive them, “2000 dirhams is not enough to run families. It is impossible.”
Soufiane Boulahyaoui was an employee who worked up to a management position at a multi-operational business in Taghazout and briefly received the MAD 2000 ($212) monthly subsidy. During border closures, his employers could not renew his contract and he has not received any proper wages or subsidies since March 2021. 
Boulahyaoui studied economics at a university in Agadir. He chose to go into the tourism sector because when he grew up, tourism appeared to be the most affluent field in Agadir. He has found his outgoing personality suits the work and enjoys helping tourists find the “good vibes” in his beautiful region. 
As much as Boulahyaoui “loves” working in the tourism sector, the young man feels the Moroccan government should take more responsibility for the workers’ suffering as it built the economy on tourism, leaving people like him with few other job options.
With the borders now open, there will not be an immediate return to business as usual. Even for those who can reopen and return to work, there is debt and emotional impact to heal from. As well, there are lingering fears that the Moroccan government will close borders again as an impractical solution to an ongoing pandemic. 
What remains absent from these conversations is how the already disadvantaged uncontracted workers have been grossly affected. Already hired and used illegally, workers without contracts have not received any social support and are unlikely to easily find jobs with remaining businesses running on a bare minimum.

201,7 Things Animal Lovers Want You to Know About Moroccan Stray Dogs,"While some countries have infrastructure and finances to provide care for stray animals, Moroccans must rely on the NGOs working hard at this problem while they stop abusing strays.",Brooke Benoit,"Jan. 27, 2022 6:34 p.m.","Agadir - A woman on the beach in Aourir, Morocco wails over the murder of her loved one. Her husband and friends comfort her. Some strangers supportively respond to her social media post about the incident. Other strangers think she is ridiculous for crying over a dead dog.
Lena Wendt’s friend Rosa was a local dog cared for by Wendt and her neighbors after Rosa’s owner died last year. Friendly, collar-wearing Rosa died a slow painful death from poisoned food intentionally put along the beach to kill animals, pets, or strays alike. 
At the same time Rosa was dying, attackers killed dozens of dogs in Sidi Yahya Zaer, twenty kilometers from Rabat. The dogs were brutally shot even though the Ministry of the Interior has signed an agreement to reduce stray dog populations through sterilization rather than bullets.
Many Moroccan animal activists and lovers are furious with the authorities for not supporting their words and allowing the cruel killing of animals to continue. Commune employees picked up the dogs, but it is unclear who shot them.
Morocco animal aid workers and Moroccans who love animals want you to know these seven things about the stray dogs in Morocco.
1 - We Will Never Get Rid of Stray Dogs
Puppy Love by Morocco Animal Aid
Beldi (country) dogs are indigenous to Morocco, living here for centuries, and are naturally a part of Morocco’s ecosystem. If you kill off or chase away stray dogs, other dogs will show up and take over the territory. 
Terrence Scott, technical lead at the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, explained to National Geographic that “if vaccinated dogs are removed from an area, new dogs—potentially rabid ones—will simply take over the territory. That’s why TNR of vaccinated animals is proven to reduce the spread of the disease.”
TNR means “trap, neuter, release” and is exactly what animal activists are working hard at to make all Moroccan stray dogs healthy through vaccination and sterilization programs.
2 - Dogs Are Not Haram to Own
Rosa on the Beach by Lena Wendt
It is a common misconception that people cannot own dogs. Lord Nazir Ahmed, a Muslim spokesman in the UK’s House of Lords, offered an Islamic position for “working dogs,” such as guard dogs, herding dogs, or those used by people with disabilities. 
Ahmed said: ""Islam is a religion that cares for people. Although it is not encouraged to keep a dog in the house, if the dog is owned for reasons of safety then it is permitted. When a disabled person is accompanied by a trained dog, such a dog becomes a blind person's eyes, and therefore, such a dog should not be stopped from entering with a blind person."" 
Muslims may keep dogs for safety and other reasons.
3 - It Is Within Islamic Principles to Care for Street Dogs
Mahdi and Friend by Morocco Animal Aid
While many Muslims believe that dogs are impure and therefore disliked in Islamic principles, this is incorrect. Dogs’ salvia invalidates wudu and must be properly cleaned off of clothing before praying. All animals have their place in nature and there is no directive to needlessly harm them.
Just consider the hadith of the prostitute who gave water to a suffering dog and “was forgiven” for her mercy to the animal. 
4 - Animals are Not Toys or Other Insentient Objects
Puppy! By Morocco Animal Aid
Often a child or adult will find a cute kitten or puppy on the street and take it home for a period. When the animal becomes a nuisance to care for they will then return it to the street. 
Veterinary surgeon Dr. Ayoub M. Banderker explains the seriousness of this habit, “Abandoned pets cannot fend for themselves, with the result that they starve and experience untold suffering, cruelty, and an eventual, agonizing death.”
5 - Teach Children it is Haram to Participate in Any “Blood Sport” Like Dogfighting
Dogs and Friends by Morocco Animal Aid
Debates remain over the commonality of stray dog attacks in Morocco and certainly there are instances of unprovoked attacks. But what of people, especially children, attacking stray dogs and other animals for amusement? Children harming animals is not behavior restricted to would-be psychopaths. 
Children test limits and this includes their power over others. Animals are easy targets of violence from children and sometimes adults. Intentionally hurting animals or provoking them to hurt each other for amusement is inhumane and therefore haram.
6 - You Cannot Kill Dogs and Other Animals Without Valid Reason
Dogs Play with Horse by Lena Wendt
Poisoning stray dogs on the beach is a senseless act of violence, as is shooting them to decrease their numbers as this method is proven ineffective.
Whatever your belief system, killing any animal larger than a small bird without a valid reason is worthy of persecution and judgment. If the animal has an owner or someone who regularly cares for it, you can be taken to a court of law for cruelty to animals or be judged by God. 
7 - Tagged Dogs are The Best Stray Dogs
Happy Dog by Morocco Animal Aid
Whenever you see a stray dog with a plastic tag through its ear, this means the dog is being cared for. It has been vaccinated and sterilized. Workers and residents feed it and the dog is friendly enough to not worry about or bother it all.
President of Morocco Animal Aid Azzedine Abdelghali wants fellow Moroccans to know this about dogs: “They are the most gentle, kind, loving animals. And they are intelligent and can even be the best partner someone can have.” 
There is no reason to hurt stray dogs.

202,Artisans Warn Morocco Losing its Tourist Appeal as More Businesses Close,"While one Marrakechi family clings to their business during the border closures, how much creativity can we expect them to exert to survive?",Brooke Benoit,"Jan. 27, 2022 2:23 p.m.","Agadir - Forty years ago Abdelkabir Errazki of Marrakech was a teenager learning his family’s ironwork trade. A hand injury forced him to turn to tailoring instead. For several years he worked under tailors of all sorts, learning to work with a variety of fabrics, including leather. Eventually, he would begin his own leather shop in Souk Talaa in the heart of Marrakech’s medina.
Just as when it opened, the shop is still just 1.5 by 2 meters square and contains just one industrial sewing machine. The shop is so small that Errazki does most of his pattern cutting at home where he has more space. 
Errazki slowly built up his business, creating the artisanal leather goods commonly found in Moroccan markets, as well as creating custom work for clients, and working towards specializing in making leather jackets. Over time his skills became known well enough that he was asked to help designers with leather pieces for their clothing brands.
New family business
Reda Errazki designing at home during lockdown in Marrakech 
Errazki’s nephew Ahmed began working with him about twenty years ago. They erected a table outside the shop for Ahmed to work on and to this day they bring it in every night. Errazki’s son Reda would frequently visit his father's leather shop as a child, and loved the work his father did. 
Sometimes when Reda stopped by his father would be collaborating with designers who also appreciated Errazki’s talent. Still, these designers “sell things my father made for a lot of money, but he did not get enough pay for what he did.”
This reaffirmed for Reda how wrong it is that the Moroccan market does not value artisanal work. It fuelled his interest to do something about improving the view of all the overlooked “treasures” Morocco has.
Reda also began to enjoy making things for himself, but his family preferred that he not continue in the artisanal sector. Reda says, “They wished I followed any government jobs or anything to just secure my monthly salary. Because they do not feel financially secure and do not want the same for me.”
As with many creative people with entrepreneurial tendencies, while studying economics and management at university, Reda could not resist pursuing his passion for “photography, design, customization, graphics, web design…” and he is “still digging” for other untapped outlets.
Reda still had the outlet of making his own bags in his father’s shop. Then thinking of ways to make pocket money, he “had an idea to use bags that people are making in the market and open a website.” When he had time to make them, his original designs were also listed.
Reda did all the work of curating his fathers’, his own, and others’ high-quality products, taking photos, writing the product descriptions, uploading the items, and providing customer service.
As it goes with many first attempts at anything, Reda says “of course, it didn't work because it wasn't great. It was my first experience with trying to sell online, so I saw that I need a lot of things for this.”
As soon as he graduated university in 2018, the young Errazki threw himself back into the designing and selling game. Reda went back online, able to better present his product, but struggled to have enough product made to present. With the help of community, family, and a loan, Reda opened a physical store where he learned more about the entire producing and selling business from the ground up.
While it is flattering to constantly sell out of all the things you make, Reda continued to struggle with meeting customer demands. He also learned about how quickly original ideas can be copied, with his original designs popping up in other nearby shops.
Hard times
By the time Corona caused the Marrakech medina to completely shut down, the Errazki family had a combination of skills that kept them from entirely leaning on their savings, charity, or debt.
Suddenly everyone needed masks in Morocco and tailors like the Errazkis were ready to make them. 
Stuck at home in lockdown, consuming their savings, the Errazkis could not sit still for long. Abdelkabir began calling contacts seeking some work he could do from home. A friend connected him to an association that needed someone to sew masks. The association gave Errazki material to make 100 fabric reusable masks. 
With the help of his wife Najat they quickly made the masks and had an order for 200 more. Then 300. When the orders reached 500, they brought the sewing machine home and everyone in the family began helping to make masks.
When Erraki’s wife, three sons, and two nephews were all helping to finish the product, count, and package them, the family was “like a little factory of masks making 1000 masks a day.” At the wholesale price of one dirham ($0.10 US) per mask, this little factory-supported four generations of an extended family.
Before the mask business came along, Reda was “on my laptop learning new things about business and making money on the internet. I was working on design platforms and learning more about selling online.” As his family was making more and more masks, Reda saw another skill set to jump at. “When I saw that my father needed help, I went to sew as well. That was my opportunity to improve at sewing,” he says.
When Reda’s cousins joined in the mask making business, he had the chance to turn his attention back to being a digital artisan. He began another business selling rugs and interior decor online. As soon as he was able to, Errazki reopened his shop serving the few people who needed a tailor.
Reda is still young in his career. Whereas some families oppress their children’s work choices and others ignore the next generation’s input into family practices, the Errazkis are adapting in the field right along with Reda.
But so many other small family businesses throughout Morocco have not survived the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The World Health Organization recognized Morocco for immense financial support in wage subsidies, but many businesses are still permanently closed in Marrakech now. Reda warns that such a loss could deter tourism. 
Many tourists flocked to Morocco in large part for the aesthetic vibe created by artisans and other workers, yet the creators were already grossly undervalued and now many’s skills and work are lost.
The young Errazki’s vision is to go further with the field of Moroccan artisans, bringing them up to the level of being recognized as the skilled professionals they are. Reda plans to combine his digital skills with activities such as travel exhibitions. Using a combination of events and digital platforms, people can share information to encourage respect and support for Moroccan artisans.

203,Moroccan LGBTQ+ Youth Respond to Homophobia,The “Gay Agenda” Moroccan LGBTQ+ youth seek is mostly just creating a bilateral dialog where society can see past hateful stereotypes and embrace individuals for who they are.,Brooke Benoit,"Jan. 24, 2022 4:22 p.m.","Agadir - If a Moroccan writes a nonhomophobic book about LGBTQ+ issues in Morocco, there is sure to be a discussion on social media. As there was January 10, when Morocco World News (MWN) announced Fatima Zahra Amzkar’s publication of “Lesbian Diaries.”
The MWN article explained that “the story revolves around a girl named Tytyma who aims to break free from the persisting stigma to be able to accept her reality as a lesbian in a country that rejects homosexuality and considers it a taboo at best, and a shameful sin at worst.”
In social media discussions, commenters had plenty to say, though it is unlikely they have had time to read the recently published book. Many accused the writer, the novel’s content, and/or homosexuality in general of being “sinners” likened to “pedophiles” “confused” and so on. 
There was nothing particularly unusual about the social media threads discussing “Lesbian Diaries,” as well as the common lack of LGBTQ+ voices in the aggressively homophobic conversation. Morocco World News reached out to three young LGBTQ+ people asking them to share their thoughts and feelings on this publication and the general situation affecting them in Morocco.
MWN asked the youths “How do you feel about the publication of Lesbian Diaries?”
Mariyem Gamar is a poet, writer, producer, leader for gender equality, and  Founder and Director of Kasbah Tal'fin. Kasbah Tal’fin is the first intersectional feminist organization and platform led by and for women and LGBTQ+ youth of the Moroccan south.
Gamar responded: ""It felt bittersweet. When I was a young queer woman, growing up in the conservative coastal south of Morocco, just the idea of uncensored LGBTQ+ stories seemed like a fantasy. There were even fewer stories depicting stories of women loving women in the Muslim world, let alone in the Maghreb! Seeing “Lesbian Diaries” published is an eye-opener, that LGBTQ+ narratives are no longer invisible and youth in Arab-speaking countries are reclaiming their history from the mainstream culture.”
Hamza Dihiya, a Moroccan Queer activist responded: “ Personally, I encourage all cultural attempts that try to hear unheard voices and convey them to the farthest extent. Amzkar's novel dealing with LGBTQ+ issues is fine. Talking about different sexualities is still a matter of shame and that’s a real shame. The evidence that the time to have this discussion is that the publishing house has agreed to work with the writer and to publish the book.”
A., a bi/pan mixed-nationality young man responded that “in all likelihood, it will be an eye-opening experience to young Moroccans who are interested in at least hearing about stories and experiences of LGBTQ+ oriented individuals.”

MWN asked: “What is your experience in writing and sharing Queer stories in Morocco?”
Hamza Dihiya responded: “I love writing in general, especially when it comes to writing about the feminist issue or the queer issue. I have previously written illustrated stories in Darija under the title “Queer Morocco” that tell real stories of people from our society of different genders and non-stereotypical/ non-conforming genders.
“I wanted to tell everyone that today we exist and we participate in social life in different forms. We started our revolution and we will not stop it until we get what we want. We do not want to create problems, but rather seek to solve them.” 
Dihiya added that “I am also now planning to work on a podcast as an audio platform on topics of particular interest to queer people, including Moroccan lesbian, transgender, and non-binary women cause I  believe that in culture is the solution and the key to change.”
A. responded: “I have very little experience with either sharing or writing about “Queer” stories. Anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment is high and still often treated as a disease to be cured and not merely a piece of one's reality. Even starting a discussion on the subject is difficult and often leads to circular arguments.”
MWN asked: “Why are these stories important, especially in Morocco?”
Hamza Dihiya responded: “Any positive, neutral, or solidarity attempt to highlight the queer presence in Morocco is very important because it conveys voices and messages that are suppressed, tortured, and imprisoned because of the laws and norms of patriarchal society, religion, and other parties. 
“Writing is a kind of liberation, in fact, it is a liberation of thoughts and feelings. Our thoughts and feelings are very important. We want to say to everyone who opposes us and those who support us as well - We are here. We are not okay, but we strive to become so. So yes, they are initiatives that I encourage and love.”
A. responded: ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that,"" said Martin Luther King Jr. “Because it is important to recognize the pain and suffering that is spread by refusing to acknowledge the reality that LGBTQ+ people exist and that they should be treated as equal humans. Because first and foremost that's what they are, human.”
MWN asked: “What is your response to Moroccans who insist there is a homosexual agenda?
Gamar responded: ""Yes, there is a homosexual agenda. It's not one you can find published, but you can read it as the deep sentiment of LGBTQ+ youth and queer women to live true to themselves, to have spaces, dignity, and equal standing in society just like their heterosexual peers. And I love this agenda.""
Hamza Dihiya responded: “Talking about the existence of a gay agenda is very funny and sometimes irritating as well. I find that this saying is a weak argument that the state uses in its policy, especially so that we do not obtain our demands and natural rights. So that we do not demand and revolt, as we are considered outlaws.“
“The country’s politics are afraid of our presence and you consider it a threat. I say this because the talk of this agenda is political par excellence. There are no such things as foreign agendas. There is external solidarity in some form. Yes, but the issue of the agenda is illogical. Our struggle is a peaceful Moroccan Amazigh youth par excellence that seeks only to achieve freedom and social justice.”
A. responded: “Yes, yes there is a ‘Homosexual Agenda.’ It is an agenda to have the right to exist without discrimination. An agenda to live a life without fear and pain. Why is that such an insulting idea to Moroccans? How is it right to control and punish people for something natural AND harmless? Who is being hurt by allowing LGBTQ+ rights?”
MWN said, “From her interview: ‘When asked about what inspired her to come up with the novel’s plot, Amzkar stressed that many people still have a wrong idea about LGBTQ+...’ What wrong ideas do you want to directly address?”
Gamar responded: “Moroccan people are accommodating by their nature when they understand that you are a good person in nature. I see how many Moroccans can be homophobic and transphobic, but if you are lucky enough that they know you before knowing your identity and judge you as a good person, they won't hurt you, at least not physically.”
“But Moroccans need to listen to LGBTQ+ youth and stop attaching us to wrong stereotypes. In Kasbah Tal'fin, we launched a  #queermorocco campaign in 2020 where allies and LGBTQ+ youth became visible talking about wrongful stereotypes. But there needs to be much more dialogue to replace fear with love and acceptance.""
A: “The idea that it is a disease to be treated, The idea that governments should hold back peoples rights simply because the culture demands it. The idea that we as a people somehow lose something when LGBTQ+ people gain rights.”

206,Significant Achievements by Moroccan Women in 2021,Morocco has been continuously creating opportunities for women to integrate many fields and take the lead in positions that were once designed only for men.,Oumaima Latrech,"Dec. 31, 2021 7:59 p.m.","Morocco has in recent years made giant strides in promoting women’s rights -- to adhere to international standards and close the persisting inequality gap between men and women in many areas. 
With a long history of dedication to fighting oppressive narratives and making a place for themselves in society, Moroccan women are now represented in all fields, from sports and arts to politics and economics.
Indeed, the list is very long of inspiring, canonized Moroccan women whose bravery and infectious passion for social change remain central to the country’s history. For now, however, let’s just revel in the New Year spirit and celebrate the power of women in Morocco by looking back on the achievements of female Moroccan changemakers who made headlines in 2021.
Women in politics
This year, Moroccan politics welcomed seven new ministers in the Aziz Akhannouch government, making a third of the government’s representatives. Women’s participation in the government testifies to Morocco’s efforts to improve the lives of women.
Their participation in politics and the country’s affairs has a trickle-down effect that will touch the lives of all women.
Nadia Fellah Alaoui, who is now the Minister of Economy and Finance, was the first woman to be appointed as the Minister of Tourism in the previous, Saadeddine El Othmani-led government. 
Minister Delegate Ghita Mezzour has made a name for herself through her active engagement in Big Data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity.
Other women at the forefront of government include: Fatima Zahra Ammor as Minister of Tourism and Handicraft, Fatima-Zahra Mansouri as Minister of Housing, Aouatif Hayar as Minister of Women, Family, and Social Integration, and Leila Benali as Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development.
Nabila Rmili, who stepped down from her new position as Minister of Heath a few days after her appointment, retains her role as the first female mayor of Casablanca. Meanwhile, Asmaa Rhlalou, a journalist and the former deputy of the National Rally of Independents party (RNI) in the House of Representatives, and Fatima-Zahra Mansouri are the mayors of Rabat and Marrakech, respectively.
Moroccan women in science
Two Moroccan scientists and researchers at Mohammed V University, Rajaa Cherkaoui El Moursli and Farida Fassi, have made it to the list of top 50 scientists worldwide according to the international 2021 AD Scientific Index. They hold 33rd and 38th place respectively.
El Moursli, a professor of nuclear physics, holds the highest-ranking in Morocco, Africa, and the Arab League, while Fassi, a professor of physics at the Faculty of Sciences, follows closely in second-ranking across the regions.
In 2015, El Moursli received the L'Oreal-UNESCO Award for Women in Science for her contribution to proving the existence of the Higgs Boson. She is the first Moroccan woman to receive the prestigious award. 
Professor Fassi contributed to the research of High Energy Physics, as well as to the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Computing Grid, which sets out to solve the problem of data storage for the LHC.
Moroccan women as global influencers
Sanae Lahlou was selected as a Young Global Leader in 2021 by The World Economic Forum (WEF).
Lahlou is known for her leadership at the forefront of several projects with high potential for African business communities in Morocco and elsewhere across Africa, both in the public and private sectors.
She is now the director of consulting firm Mazars' Africa Business Unit in Morocco. Lahlou works to connect African Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and creative start-ups by expanding their growth opportunities and transforming them into African and global champions.
The “young global leader” title adds to her achievements as an African sustainability changemaker.
Another Moroccan to make the headlines for her activism and commitment to provide girls around the globe with proper education is Iman Hammam.
Super Model Hammam was the first to receive the She’s the First (STF) inaugural Powerhouse of the Year Award. She is also the ambassador of STF, an organization that sponsors girls' education in developing nations.
She collaborated for the first time with the organization in 2019, taking her social media platform to spread the cause, raise awareness about access for education for all, and empower young girls worldwide through education.
First Moroccan woman as General Manager of Microsoft Morocco 
In November 2021, Salima Amira was appointed General Manager of Microsoft Morocco. 
With 17 years of experience as a leader in competitive environments, such as Inwi and IBM, Amira firmly established herself in a field historically dominated by men when she became the first woman to hold the position of General Manager of Microsoft Morocco. The Casablanca subsidiary was founded in 1993. 
She is responsible for conceptualizing strategies, allocating resources, developing and maintaining relationships within regional sales and marketing departments, as well as coordinating with other Microsoft subsidiaries. 
Amira graduated from the Mohammadia School of Engineers in 2003 and from the Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in 2010, she previously worked as a sales executive and sales business unit manager within digital services companies (ENS), before joining the team of Moroccan telecoms operator Inwi in 2011. 
Moroccans as Most Powerful Businesswomen in the MENA region
In February 2021, Forbes magazine featured four Moroccan women in the Middle East’s Power Businesswomen 2021 list.
Nezha Hayat was the first Moroccan to appear on the list, ranking eighth in the list of 50. Hayat is the CEO of Morocco’s Capital Market Authority and the president of the Africa Middle East Regional Committee at the International Organization of Securities Commissions.
The founder and CEO of AKSAL Group, Salwa Idrissi Akhannouch ranked 19th. Married to the current Head of Government Aziz Akhannouch, Salwa is an accomplished businesswoman. Her company is engaged in social community work and implemented a social project to support cultural, educational, and health projects across Morocco.
Rita Maria Zniber, the chairman and CEO of Diana Holding, occupied the 33rd rank. With over 50 years of experience in the food and beverage industry, Zniber’s company scope mainly includes agriculture, olive growing, poultry farming, trade, and distribution. 
She is also the founder of the Rita Zniber Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports abandoned children in Morocco.
The 36th ranking went to Miriem Bensalah Chaqroun, the director of Holmarcom Group and the CEO of Oulmes, the largest mineral water company in Morocco. In 2019, the Moroccan businesswoman was appointed by the United Nations’ Secretary-General to join the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) alliance.
Women in cinema and arts
As stereotypes change, women are gradually being involved in the film industry in all roles behind the camera.
The Moroccan artist Meriem Bennani was the first Moroccan in the history of the Paris Fashion Week to assume the artistic direction of the fashion show. 
Bennani decorated the show space and operated the Miu Miu livestream through displaying artwork and a series of artistic interventions starring her own mother and highlighting a fine line between virtual and real life.
Born in 1988 in Morocco, Bennani attended Cooper Union College in New York where she studied visual arts.
During the lockdown last year, Bennani teamed up with documentary filmmaker Orian Barki to animate a series of videos posted on Instagram titled “2 Lizards.” The miniseries of two lizards wandering in the streets of Brooklyn emptied of its inhabitants caught the eye of many netizens.
Bennani’s work addresses the complexity of social and political issues persisting in today’s society, including migration, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the place of women in society.
In September 2021, Morocco hosted the first female-only organized Short Film Festival in Marrakech. The event was co-organized by Moroccan artist Ramia Beladel and French national Thais Martin.
The co-founders aimed to spotlight Moroccan filmmaking internationally by highlighting Moroccan and foreign talents in the industry.
In her work, Beladel illustrates subjects of everyday life in a multi-layered way. Her aim is to make the viewer imagine and interpret her artwork without being hindered by the historical reality.
In another film accolade, in October 2021, Moroccan actress Sandia Tajeddine won the Best Actress award at the 2021 Jordan International Film Festival.
Born in 1994, the actress began her career in theater at seven years old in school plays and camps. She graduated from the Rabat-based Higher Institute of Dramatic Art and Cultural Activities in 2017 and has since played challenging roles in many films and series, such as “Banat El Assas,” “The Punch,” and “Yacout W Anbar.”
These are just a few examples of Moroccan women who made the headlines this year. 
Throughout the last decades, Morocco has accumulated steady but notable progress to promote women's situation and boost their inclusion in many fields. 
But while the country -- and the world in general -- has indeed made significant progress on the women’s rights front in recent years, much is still left to do as no country in the world has yet achieved full gender equality, according to the United Nations.

208,The Most Fascinating Scientific Findings Within Morocco in 2021,The findings are shifting scientists’ research on early human civilizations to the North African region.,Nisrine Jaouadi,"Dec. 30, 2021 11:29 a.m.","Morocco has been at the center of several recent discoveries that have made headlines, both locally and internationally. The discoveries allowed archeologists to uncover some of the most fascinating secrets of ancient civilizations. Below are 6 of the most recent Moroccan discoveries.
Oldest rock carving in North Africa
Research professors at Moroccan and Spanish universities discovered rock engravings dating back to the Paleolithic age, which was roughly 2.5 million years ago, at the Camel Cave in the province of Berkane.
According to the Department of Culture of the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Communication, the engravings are about 12,000 years old, corresponding to the last ice age, which also affected Morocco’s northern region.
The national discovery was part of a scientific agreement between the National Institute of Archeology and Cultural Heritage (INSAP) and the Mohammed I University of Oujda on a collaboration project regarding the prehistoric human communities in the Orient.
The Department of Culture stated the archeological findings will have a very positive impact on sustainable development.
Old Macaque Fossil 
A team of scientists from Moroccan and Spanish universities discovered a macaque fossil in Guefait, a town in the province of Jerada, in the eastern region of Morocco.
According to the Catalonian news outlet Catalan Diari Mes, the fossils, which date back to about 2.5 million years, are assigned to the genus Macaca, a gregarious Old-World monkey of the subfamily Cercopithecinae.
The species is estimated to have lived for 6 or 7 million years and their remains are commonly found in North Africa, but can also be found in Europe, where they migrated due to the Messinian Salinity Crisis over 5.5 million years ago.
The Journal of Human Evolution, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, suggests that future research may help fill the gap in the fossil record and determine whether the absence of the species is due to its local extinction in Africa.
Prehistoric community in the Anti-Atlas
The debitage stone, discovered at the rock site Imaoun, located in Southern Morocco, indicates  the existence of a possible prehistoric community.
Levallois lithic material, which represents a sophisticated way of shaping stone tools in prehistoric times, was discovered in the region as a result of excavations carried out there between 2017 and 2018.
As stated in the digital platform for interdisciplinary research on the Canary Islands, Almogaren, the community would have lived about twenty kilometers northeast of the Akka oasis in the Anti-Atlas.
The region is characterized by its “complex geological systems” primarily composed of sandstone and quartzites, dating back to the Paleozoic era, which began about 541 million years ago.
The recorded discoveries at the site include “two nuclei, as well as five flakes all belonging to Levallois technology.” Findings suggest a site of large scale and show clear evidence of prehistoric existence. 
Ancient Marine Lizard
Archeologists in Morocco discovered a new species of Mosasaur, a marine lizard with shark-like cutting teeth, which lived about 72 to 66 million years ago.
Based on two complete skulls and referred jaws, scientists were able to reconstruct the species and reveal some of the unique characteristics.
According to a scientific paper in the Cretaceous Research journal, the marine species measured eight meters in length, unlike most of its relatives, which were unable to grow more than a few meters. It also had “elongate and robust jaws, small teeth, and specialized tooth implantation.”
The creature had poor eyesight and “relied on nonvisual cues including touch and chemoreception during foraging, as in modern marine snakes,” according to the paper.
New artifact suggests Morocco as origin of human culture
Research on ancient jewelry recovered from the Bizmoune cave in the South West of Morocco indicates the ornaments may represent the earliest evidence of advanced human culture.
There have been 33 shell beads recovered, dating back to over 142,000 years, which would place them in the late Middle Pleistocene period, the same geologic time period as the earliest documented emergence of humanity.
An academic paper published by Science Advances stated that the artifacts are considered the first sign of “symbolic behavior” by early Homo sapiens.
The primitive jewelry is “widely interpreted as evidence for expanding social networks and complexity of social interactions,” says the paper.
The researchers stated that the findings completely altered the study of human civilization during its early stages, allowing North Africa to become a prominent academic focus on the subject.
Unique dinosaur fossil
Scientists discovered a dinosaur fossil with “bizarre” spikes dating back to about 168 million years ago in Morocco’s Boulahfa in the Middle Atlas Mountains.
The discovery is unprecedented to scientists and archaeologists alike. The remains of the heavily armored creature have preserved defensive spikes that are fused to the skeleton.
The fossil belongs to an Ankylosaurus, a type of herbivore species of dinosaurs that are known for their “ebony armpit that once covered their backs,” according to the Natural History Museum.
The finding is now part of the collection at the Natural History Museum, where researchers will continue to study the remains.
The new discovery represents a significant milestone because it is the first time a fossil of this type has been discovered in Africa.

210,After COP-26 The World Needs Practical Climate Solutions,"While the Glasgow climate conference featured numerous pledges and long-term goals, Morocco and OCP Group have both taken their own unique practical approaches.",Jasper Hamann,"Dec. 10, 2021 4:22 p.m.","Rabat - Now that the global COP-26 climate conference has concluded, the international response to the event has called for practical solutions after weeks of high-level political dialogue.. 
Politicians involved in the annual conference have hailed the event as a definitive moment that keeps alive the ambition to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees. Now that the international community has once again strengthened its commitment to combating climate change, the next step depends on comprehensive practical action that supports the variety of promising pledges. 
Practical and structural solutions are more necessary than ever amid COVID-19 and economic difficulties that have frustrated much-needed climate action over the past year. 
While many countries and organizations now face the task of finding practical solutions to make their climate pledges a reality, Morocco and OCP Group are each presenting their own individual  practical roadmaps that leave little doubt.
Complementary action 
Many governments around the world have the difficulty of achieving climate ambitions in the face of opposition from local economic actors. In Morocco, the relationship is altogether more complementary. 
Phosphate and fertilizer giant OCP Group is intimately involved in Morocco’s national climate ambitions. The group’s CEO Mostafa Terrab has described green development as the company’s future, a commitment that is evident in its yearly sustainability reports.
Climate action is at the heart of OCP’s daily work. The group lists its continued reductions in CO2 and SO2 emissions and water use not as a distant pledge, but as part of its current essential outputs. The group is rapidly transitioning in a variety of innovative ways, contributing significantly to Morocco’s ambitious climate commitments.
Such action is not a luxury or gimmick for OCP as its largest growth market in Africa simply does not have the luxury to ignore climate change. Rising temperatures are set to most severely impact Africa, and the global South as a whole. 
Increased droughts call for better farming practices and technology, growing populations require increased yields from local agriculture, while diminishing water supplies require innovative practices such as water recycling and the use of unconventional water resources. 
Practical results
OCP’s commitments are evident in its daily activities while achieving important results every year. Some of the group’s actions are already improving lives and local communities, as seen in the 305 hectares of land the company has rehabilitated into “carbon sinks,” stretches of nature that actively reduce carbon in the environment.
Already OCP is meeting 31% of its water needs from unconventional water resources from recycled waste water to innovative technological solutions such as desalination plants. The group’s integrated climate priorities mean the company has already achieved the remarkable feat of having 89% of its energy needs met through clean energy.
Morocco is similarly engaged with national climate projects, from mega-projects such as the world-renowned Noor Solar plant to smaller-scale measures that allow citizens to generate sustainable energy at home. 
Unsurprisingly, the complementary relationship between Morocco and its largest enterprise has yielded significant results. 
These combined efforts have placed Morocco as the world’s fifth best country on climate performance, while OCP was declared both the 4th most sustainability-minded food business while receiving a Vigeo Eiris rating of 84/100 for supporting communities and 69/100 on the environment.
While both Morocco and OCP Group have received praise for their efforts, neither are willing to rest on their laurels. CEO Mostafa Terrab has committed OCP to becoming “the most sustainable business we can be,” and every day provides another step in that direction.
Future ambitions
OCP Group has outlined its priorities alongside the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and aims to provide a valuable contribution in a variety of important fields. 
OCP’s role as one of the world’s largest fertilizer companies allows it to contribute to one of the SDGs most important targets, realizing zero hunger outlined in SDG 2. The group has vowed to double their R&D budget within five years, produce tailored fertilizers for farming communities, and expand the geographical reach of its agricultural support programs.
Practically this has meant that in 2020 alone, OCP has spent $4.9 million on R&D exclusively to find solutions for farmers. This has resulted in the development of 10 specific fertilizer formulas for African countries, and 351,329 farmers benefiting from its programs.
Furthermore, OCP has committed itself to advancing quality education (SDG4) by training farmers, employees and suppliers, providing incubators for innovative small agri-businesses and supporting cooperatives and associations through financial support. OCP additionally helps fund research and innovation at Morocco’s Mohammed VI Polytechnic University.
The company takes its societal responsibilities further by promoting decent work and economic growth (SDG8). The group is committing to having women make up 47% of its workforce by 2030, invest in local suppliers and dedicate $61 million to related R&D in 2020 alone.
OCP’s commitment to creating sustainable cities and communities (SDG11) saw it spend $200 million on the futuristic Technopole Forum in southern Morocco and $500 million on the Mazagan sustainable city project. Together, these projects are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs in the coming years.
With climate action as a priority, OCP Group is planning to halve its SO2 output by 2023, have 100% of its water needs covered by sustainable sources, and rehabilitate 1000 hectares of land as part of its efforts to reach responsible consumption and production (DSG12) targets.
On climate action (SDG13), OCP has already reduced its CO2 intensity in 2020 and uses 89% clean energy. By 2030, OCP aims to have reduced its carbon footprint by half, and have all its energy needs generated sustainably.
While there are many questions remaining about the world’s transition towards a sustainable future through effective climate action, OCP has presented its vision clearly, while every day producing meaningful steps towards realizing its ambitions. Meaningful global action requires concrete action and Morocco and OCP are showing how to lead the way.

211,"Samta Mining to Invest $100 Million, Leads Indian Business to Morocco","In its search for base metals, Samta sees Morocco as having both great potential and being a welcoming place for its new business venture.",Jasper Hamann,"Dec. 09, 2021 2:18 p.m.","Rabat - Indian innovation-oriented company Samta Group announced on December 8 that it plans to invest MAD 922 million ($100 million) in Morocco over the next five years. 
In a statement by the company’s Chairman Purushottam Agrawal, the Indian group described Morocco as a “natural choice” in its expansion in Africa.
The group’s mining arm, Samta Mines, will focus on mining and mineral processing in Morocco, following close cooperation with the Moroccan Agency for Investment and Export Development (AMDIE).
Morocco World News spoke to the company’s general manager in Morocco, Dr Amit Tripathi about Samta’s goals and ambitions in the kingdom. Dr Tripathi is currently occupied with the establishment of Samta’s head office in Morocco before the ideal locations for its planned mining and processing operations will be negotiated.
Dr Tripathi explained that Morocco has “lots of potential,” with the company primarily interested in base metals, such as copper, lead, zinc, silver, antimony. Samta Mining has roughly four years of experience in Africa, as part of its global operations, and appointed a general manager for Morocco that is very familiar with the kingdom. 
Samta’s close contact with AMDIE has been an essential component of the company’s expansion into Morocco. Cooperation with the investment agency “have been very positive,” Dr Tripathi stated, adding that he felt “thoroughly welcomed,” in Morocco since his arrival. 
“Our decision to expedite our decision to come to Morocco, AMDIE had a role to play in it,” Tripathi emphasized.
About Samta Group
Samta Group is an unlisted Indian public company, with a diverse array of investments through its network of companies. The Group is headquartered in Mumbai, India’s commercial capital and financial hub. It is chaired by renowned Indian businessperson Purushottam Agrawal, who is also the founder and vice-chairman of pharmaceutical giant Ajanta Pharma.
In addition to including its own mining arm, Samta’s companies work on innovative fields such as biotechnology, blockchain and artificial intelligence, fintech, and renewable energy. The Group includes several specialized companies located around the world. 
Headquartered in India are Samta Mines, biotech company GenCrest, renewable energy company Samta Energy, while the group additionally partners with Quantumzyne, which produces enzymes. Outside India, research firm Phyllozyme is based in Philadelphia and blockchain initiative InfiniChains operates from San Francisco and India’s IT hub Pune.
Samta’s planned expansion into Morocco comes as part of Samta Mines, which already operates in two other mineral-rich African countries -- Uganda and Congo. Samta Mines focuses on strategic metals and minerals, which are essential ingredients to produce components for modern technology and industry. In Congo, Samta has a focus on copper and cobalt, while its Ugandan operations centers around nickel, tin, copper, and cobalt.
Samta Mines in Morocco
Samta Mines targets three specific types of metals and minerals. Firstly, the firm produces “energy metals” used in energy generation, transportation and storage. These include antimony, copper, lean, nickel and zinc. Secondly, the mining company extracts tin, tungsten and gold, used to produce mobile phones, jewelry and modern cars. Finally, the company mines for rare-earth elements that are essential for modern displays, cameras and IT components.
“Samta’s projects in Uganda and Congo are already three to four years old,” Dr Tripathi stated, adding that “mineral discoveries have already been made.” The company is expecting further promising mineral discoveries there. “Work in progress there is already ahead, in Morocco we are just starting,” Tripathi commented. 
In Morocco, Samta aims to mine copper, lead, zinc, silver, antimony, which is used to produce a variety of modern essential technology for sectors such as transportation and telecommunications. 
Having traveled around Morocco, Samta’s local general manager saw “a lot of areas with lots of potential.” However, Tripathi emphasized, “a lot of technical inputs are still required to take these opportunities to the level where they should be.” 
Samta’s planned investments in Morocco are part of its “brownfield expansion strategy,” indicating the Indian company is planning to purchase or lease local production facilities with the aim of launching new production. The company has highlighted that “our operations in Morocco are aimed at developing a committed and promising business in mining and mineral processing.”
Mining in Morocco
The mining sector is a large part of Morocco’s economic drivers, given the wealth of natural resources located within the country’s borders. The industry employs 40,000 Moroccans and makes up 21% of the country’s exports, according to government data.
The sector is governed by the Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development (formerly known as the Ministry of Energy, Mining, and Environment), which aims to further expand the sector through domestic and foreign investment. 
Mining is one of the major pillars of Morocco’s export appeal to foreign investors. 
Morocco’s investment and export brand Morocco Now has been one of the links that brought Samta Mines to Morocco. At a Morocco Now roadshow event, the company met with Morocco’s Ambassador to India, Mohammed Maliki, and representatives of AMDIE.
Representatives of the company visited Morocco and met local AMDIE officials, leading to the appointment of Samta’s general manager for Morocco, Amit Tripathi and the announcement of a 5-year investment in mining and mineral processing in the North African kingdom. 
Samta Chairman Purushottam Agrawal stated the company hopes to have a “long standing relation with Morocco and to enlarge and diversify our investment in the future there.” 
Samta’s General Manager in Morocco, Dr Tripathi, echoed that sentiment and appeared to be excited at the prospect of launching the Indian company's Moroccan operations. 
“I’ve been in and out of Morocco over the last two or three years, I know that it is a beautiful country, with very friendly and cooperative people,” he told MWN. “I am very happy to have been very thoroughly welcomed everywhere we have been.”

212,Anytime Fitness Bids to Revolutionize Morocco’s Fitness Industry,CEO of Anytime Fitness’ North Africa Branch spoke to Morocco World News about the group’s vision and ambitions for Morocco.,Issam Toutate,"Dec. 06, 2021 11:01 a.m.","Fitness is a booming industry in Morocco, and there are reports that the pandemic and the heightened anxiety and stress levels that accompanied the COVID crisis have even convinced many Moroccans to pick up some forms of exercise to stay physically fit and mentally sharp.
Enter Anytime Fitness, a  worldwide fitness and wellbeing establishment that, while projecting to take advantage of Morocco’s apparently thriving fitness industry, is more fundamentally driven by the need to bring it to the next level. 
“For me Anytime Fitness means so much more than just changing the life of my future franchisees and customers,” Zakieia Rouah, the CEO of Anytime Fitness’ North Africa Branch, told Morocco World News as she presented the group’s philosophy and ambitions. 
Revolutionize is a big, even pretentious word. In the right hands, however, the idea it entails - radical change or transformation - can be rewarding and liberating. In Rouah’s telling, establishing Anytime Fitness is “a starting point of a fulfilling personal and collective journey.”
While there are already other fitness companies in Morocco, Rouah pitches Anytime Fitness’ idea of total fitness by insisting on what is bound to make the project’s business model unique: professionalism, accessibility, and community-building. 
Still, Anytime Fitness’ Moroccan story has had its shares of challenges and usual bumps in the road. Among these has been gender-related issues and a culture of slow and traditional bureaucracy that often does not encourage entrepreneurship.
Despite all these hurdles, says an energized Zakieia Rouah, “the continued welcome from the people of Casablanca has been so immense that their energy is keeping me going.”
Below is an extended and redacted version of Rouah’s interview with MWN. 
MWN: Can you tell us about your desire to support and help others who have always dreamed of owning their own small business?
Zakieia Rouah: I am mainly driven by the desire  to make a difference in the lives of others. I like to build things, brainstorm, and come up with an idea to help those around me. 
For me Anytime Fitness means so much more than just changing the life of my future franchisees and customers. Building my business made me realize the immediate difference it will bring in the lives of my family. My brothers and sisters, in the lives of my nieces and nephews, in the lives of my friends and acquaintances.
The realization that this is in itself just a starting point of a fulfilling personal and collective journey is a huge motivation for me. 
MWN: What was your desire to help others lead healthier, happier lives – so that they can “pay it forward” and help others in many different ways?
Zakieia Rouah: Sports and fitness have been an important part of Moroccan life for quite a long time now. Many people in Morocco have always been involved in sports, as it connects us in an unprecedented way. Health is a gift and the Moroccans take that gift seriously and try to implement healthy practices into their lives.
The market potential in Morocco is enormous, but the implementation of fitness clubs has unfortunately not yet gone through the changes that it needs.
We see a potential in the high-end market that is greatly overpriced. These are mostly stand-alone clubs, which offer small-scale fitness, massages, spa, swimming pools, and hammams. Through all that they offer, we can see that fitness itself is not their core business value.
Low- budget gyms are the other available option. These gyms often only provide fitness and are geared toward appealing to Moroccans of all walks of life. However, hygiene, equipment, approach, personalization, and customer service are typically not a priority for this type of gym.
Anytime Fitness is the perfect gym for all your basic needs. We are accessible, clean, and offer personalized customer service all for a great price. 
MWN: Can you explain your desire to help bring people closer together via fitness? There is too much conflict in the world today. Would you say that exercising together can help us see that “We’re all the same?”
Zakieia Rouah: I see that people are increasingly focusing on their health and they understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle.  The healthy  lifestyle is becoming more popular and with that more people are desiring to go out of their comfort zones and look for places to enhance themselves. 
My parents have always been a huge source of inspiration, but I have also been greatly inspired by feeling and experiencing how beautiful we can be to one another. With this, I believe we are capable of achieving whatever we desire as long as we work towards it. 
Unknown or ordinary Moroccans are a huge inspiration for me. I say this in the sense that our society is full of stories of people doing nice or beautiful things for strangers, simply out of the kindness of their hearts.
If we were to take a moment out of our busy schedule and interact with each other, we will experience that we are all the same, that life does not judge us differently because of gender, age, or color. 
MWN: What Potential does Morocco have in the fitness industry? 
Zakieia Rouah: The market potential in Morocco is enormous, but the implementation of fitness clubs has unfortunately not yet gone through the changes that it needs. 
The fitness market in Morocco is an underpenetrated market, it has a direct impact on the economy in terms of revenue and employment, and don’t forget the ripple effect that it has on our enormous supply chain. 
With Anytime Fitness we are not only contributing to the health of the Moroccan people, but we are also growing the market potential of the industry. We are actively providing new opportunities for entrepreneurs. And being the largest and the number one franchising fitness organization in the world, provides us with the possibility of aligning and securing enormous discounts on equipment, accessories and the best lease options with the biggest players in the field. 
Anytime Fitness is the perfect and safest way of establishing passive income. Our franchisees reach cash flow break even after approximately six months after that with a Return on Investment of more than 32% per year. This is one of the reasons that over 60% of our franchisees go on to own more than one club. Meanwhile, what most franchisees value most is the ability to achieve financial freedom.
MWN: What do you see as the biggest challenge now that you are setting up AF Morocco? How do you deal with that?
Zakieia Rouah: The Kingdom of Morocco has been making rapid and fast changes in supporting female entrepreneurship.
In the last decade great structures in education, industry (setting up programs to support the female presence in engineering, science fields), as well as wellness and hospitality have been set up through foundations, along with  one presided by our Princess Lalla Selma with great support from her husband our King Mohammed VI.
However, we still unfortunately deal with the still existing bureaucracy. This issue is still relevant to Morocco and even to the extent that it easily can be used to block new entrepreneurs. At the same time, I have to admit to myself that it is also not always easy to be a young woman.
Many business people still prefer to deal with more senior people, expecting age to be a crucial factor for finding comfort in engaging in business.
If we would also add the entire supply chain of construction companies, materials, as well as access to the best equipment, we all should be embracing this.
As a Dutch-Moroccan, I am making a huge investment and not being a multi-billion dollar investor does not make me any less important looking at the economic and social impact we are bringing to the small entrepreneurs in Morocco.
Support from both the Dutch and the Moroccan sides were very limited. However, the continued welcome from the people of Casablanca has been so immense that their energy is keeping me going and reassuring me that with their support, my team and I are determined to never give up!
MWN: What is the strength of your business model? What do you think makes your model particularly appealing or outstanding? Name three points.
Zakieia Rouah: Our global presence and the 24/7 accessibility are what in my opinion make AF a genuine model. Worldwide, people are offered the same services and we can provide high-level assistance in helping them reach their goals in and outside of the gym.
Our model is one that makes our members and franchisees the number one priority. Happy members make happy franchisees and allow the whole organization to grow and become better for our customers.
Our American HeadQuarter and our other franchises around the world are all so supportive and staffed with highly valuable and reliable staff. We never feel alone on this journey. They love Morocco and we love them too.
MWN: Do you see a difference in the business aspect because you are a woman?
Zakieia Rouah: Absolutely, they think they can take you less seriously and they assume in advance that you will not know what you are talking about. I cope by convincing or reminding myself to keep my calm and always stay true to my core principles in doing business. 
My only strategy in dealing with this “hurdle” is always to be on top of my game and show that I can reach anything and all within the back of my mind to make it a fun journey. Doing business can be very harsh at times; however, it is the little things you share with your biggest clients or your supplier that make the journey one to never give up on.
But there is also a lot of respect and admiration for what we are setting up. I am often humbled to see how the reaction of some partners is in knowing we are a small young team yet perform on a very high level.

213,2021 EU-Africa Business Summit Discusses OCP’s Actions for Global Food Security,"The 2021 EU-Africa Business Summit includes several international debates and discussions on topics such as agricultural development, circular economy and renewable energy.",Nisrine Jaouadi,"Nov. 29, 2021 4:43 p.m.","Rabat - Moroccan Phosphate and fertilizer giant OCP Group participated today in the EU-Africa Business Summit, to discuss the importance of agriculture and agribusiness in rural development.
The EU-Africa Business Summit is an event organized by European Business to promote the voices of enterprises in Europe and Africa.
The event was held at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Marrakech, with some speakers joining the debate in-person and others participating via zoom.
Representing OCP was the group’s CEO advisor, Iliass El Fali, who spoke on the topic along with other panelists, including the former EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Phil Hogan, the Director of the Agriculture Department in the African Union Commission, Godfrey Baghiigwa, and Samira Rafaela, a member of the European Parliament.
Most panelists argued that African agriculture and agribusiness is in dire need of public policies to attract investments and to implement climate smart policies.
El Fali affirmed that OCP is determined to support agriculture in the most efficient way possible, by creating a more sustainable agriculture with the preservation of soil health, water management, carbon capture, and the restoration of biodiversity.
The OCP official also spoke of the group’s efforts to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, arguing that this can in turn stimulate the agricultural sector while simultaneously reducing poverty.

“OCP dedicates one million ton of plant fertilizer per year to Africa. This allows us to encourage partners to invest in order to achieve supply chain efficiency and be able to provide phosphate fertilizers at the lowest cost,” said El Fali.
“Africa is part of the solution, and not part of the problem when it comes to global food security,” he added.
A huge 65 percent of global unexploited arable lands are in the African continent, and the agricultural yields in Africa are three to four times lower than the benchmarks.
OCP Group is serving both the African green revolution and the European agricultural transition with its investments in innovative actions and targeted approaches, El Fali argued.
“We are very excited to support new emerging models in Africa,” he asserted.
In partnership with Mohammed VI Polytechnic University of Benguerir (UM6P), OCP Group is currently working on the production of fortified fertilizer and orphan crops, which play a vital role in food security and the situation of small-scale farmers.
The Moroccan fertilizer giant is considered by the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) to be one of the few companies leading the world towards realizing a sustainable food system.
As Morocco boasts a significant portion of global phosphorus reserves, the company feels the “responsibility to be the phosphorus custodian globally,” the OCP official stressed.

214,‘Vaillante’: A UNICEF Original Series Tackles Worrying Trends in Child Marriage.,"The fictional mini-series explores the issue of child marriage in West and Central Africa, the regions with the highest numbers of underage brides.",Saadia Dinia,"Nov. 28, 2021 6:55 p.m.","Rabat - With recent data indicating worrying trends of child marriage that are being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF is turning to the big screen to sensitize and call for urgent global actions against the dire trends depicted in various surveys and studies.  
Child marriage generally refers to any formal marriage or informal union between a child under the age of 18 and an adult or another child. Due to entrenched gender equality worldwide, girls remain disproportionately impacted by this practice. Globally, the prevalence of child marriage among boys is just one sixth of that among girls. In some countries such as Niger or Bangladesh, girls as young as 7 or 8 are forcibly married to much older men. 
The practice is denounced in a number of international conventions and agreements, where it is regarded as a violation of children’s rights. Increasingly, it has also been recognised as “a key roadblock” to global health, development, and gender equality. 
Today, child marriage is firmly inscribed on the global development agenda, mainly through its inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals (Target 5.3) to be achieved by 2030. However, as shown by latest trends and future prospects, no region in the world is on track to achieve this goal.
Global context
While the prevalence of child marriage has decreased globally, from 1 in 4 girls married a decade ago to approximately 1 in 5 today, the practice still remains widespread. An estimated 650 million girls and women alive today were married as children, while 12 million underage girls are reported to get married every year. 
If present trends continue, more than 140 million female children are predicted to be married in the next decade, with COVID-19 presenting a threat to progress against child marriage. Up to 10 million more girls will be at risk of becoming child brides as a result of the pandemic, alerts UNICEF. 
Child marriage happens most in developing countries, where 1 in 3 girls is married before age 18, and 1 in 5 girls is married before age 15. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa regions account for the largest number of women married as children. 
An estimated 37% of young women alive today in sub-Saharan Africa were married under 18. Niger records the highest number of girl brides with 76%, followed by the Central African Republic with 68%, and Chad with 67%. 
However, recent data also show high rates in previously understudied geographies like Latin America and the Caribbean. In this part of the world, an estimated 25% of girls are wed before age 18. The practice has seen no decline over the past decade in contrast to South Asia, where levels of child marriage have dropped from nearly 50% to 30% over the same period. 
Girl child marriage is also increasingly documented in high-income countries like the United States, where it was recently described as “a hidden crisis” and “an outrage.” A report titled United States’ Child Marriage Problem, released last April by Unchained At Last, revealed poorly known facts about the issue. 
About 300,000 children with a few as young as 10 were married in the US between 2000 and 2018. The report highlights that 86% of the victims are girls being wed to adult men through legal pathways. 
Reading through the report, we also learn that child marriage is still legal in 44 US states, and it's only in recent years that the remaining six states - Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island and New York - banned the practice and eliminated all exceptions. 
Presently, 20 US states require no minimum age for marriage, with a parental or judicial waiver. Indeed, oddly jogging our memory about Article 475 of the Moroccan penal code amended in 2014, the report reveals that most US legal frameworks view child marriage as “a valid defense” to statutory rape: when one of the parties to sexual activity is below the age of consent. Meaning, rapists are exempted from the charges related to their crime if proven to have been married to their victim at the time of the intercourse.  
Regional and local contexts
Regarding the prevalence of child marriage in the Middle East and North Africa, it is described to be near the global average. The practice is more common than in regions such as East Asia or Eastern Europe, and less recurrent than in sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia. In MENA countries, around 1 in 5 women is married under 18 and 1 in 25 women is married before 15. 
While the prevalence of the practice dropped from 1 in 3 to 1 in 5 child brides over the past 25 years, progress appears to have stalled in the past decade. An estimated 700,000 child brides were recorded in recent years. Today, the region is reported by UNICEF to be home to 40 million child brides: 30 million who married between age 15 and 18, and 9 million before age 15. 
According to the same source, the occurrence of child marriage varies widely within the region, from a high of 1 in 3 in Sudan and Yemen, to a low of 1 in 50 in Tunisia (despite the fact that in Tunisia the legal age for marriage is set at 17). The report places Morocco in 6th place - right after Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, and Sudan - in terms of the pervasiveness of the practice.  16% of Moroccan women aged 20 to 24 years alive today were married or in union before age 18, and 3% before age 15. 
However, available data on child marriage in Morocco remain an “imperfect approximation,” explains another UN regional study. The reasons for this gap in evidence appear to be the lack of coordination between ministries, civil society, and international agencies regarding the research methods to adopt in order to collect data on the phenomenon, thus making available findings “disparate.” Adding to that is a dearth of national studies on the subject. 
In fact, the most recent nationally representative survey on the issue in Morocco was the Population and Family Health Survey conducted in 2010-2011. It found that in 2011, 18.7% of women aged 20-49 in Morocco married before the age of 18, while 2.6% of women aged 15-49 married before age 15. However, it did not report the percentage of all women aged 20 to 24 who married before the ages of 15 and 18, which are the global standard indicators to estimate trends in child marriage over time. 
The study also stressed how the high occurrence of customary law marriages in Morocco makes it difficult to provide accurate data on child marriage in the kingdom. Available data on the practice has been mainly supplemented by the communication of the number of legally registered underage marriages every year. In this regard, 13,335 child marriage requests were granted legal permission in 2020. 
As a matter of fact, despite the outlawing of the practice in 2004 as part of a reform in the family code or Moudawana, the rate of child marriage has been gradually increasing in Morocco (except a slight drop of 1% in 2012). 
The effects of child marriage on girls and beyond 
Actors engaged in the fight against child marriage agree on how this phenomenon “effectively ends a girl’s childhood.” It interrupts her schooling, limiting her opportunities for career and vocational advancement. It places her at increased risk of domestic violence, and increases her isolation from family and friends, taking a heavy toll on her psychological well-being. Moreover, it puts her at risk for early, frequent, and high-risk pregnancies. 
Numerous studies and NGO reports have documented the severe consequences of early pregnancies on adolescent girls. According to the World Health Organization (WTO), complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for 15-19-year-old girls globally. Relatedly, girls under 15 are reported to be five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s.
Besides, NGOs active in the fight against child marriage point to the links between child marriage and HIV. The International Women’s Health Coalition explains that given their limited power to negotiate safe sex or to access sexual and reproductive health services, child brides are at a higher risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. 
On this interlinkage, Girls not brides elaborates on how being exposed to frequent unprotected sexual activity, often because of pressure to prove their fertility, and having older and more sexually experienced husbands increases the risk of young married girls acquiring HIV. 
The “devastating” consequences of child marriage are proven to reach far beyond the girls themselves. As such, children of child brides seem to be 60% more likely to die in the first year of life than those born to mothers older than 19, and families of child brides are gauged to be more likely poor and unhealthy. 
Ultimately, because child marriage impacts a girl’s health, future and family, UNICEF reports, it imposes seizable economic costs nationally, with weighty implications for development and prosperity.

215,"How Mohamed Serraji Built NTS Technics, Engineering Company",A story looking back on a CEO’s deliberate rise to success.,Nisrine Jaouadi,"Nov. 26, 2021 12:20 p.m.","Mohamed Serraji, founder and CEO of NTS Technics, has over 30 years of experience in the engineering field.
NTS Technics is an internationally recognized leader in the aeronautics, automotive, rail and naval industries.
The engineering company provides mechanical services for the development of planes, cars, trains and boats, with a goal to design and conceive a product that will respond to its clients’ detailed specifications.
Through hard work and determination, Serraji was able to build an entire company from scratch.
Here’s a rundown on how the self-made CEO was able to grow his company, going from 2 collaborators to 70 in only two years.
An entrepreneur at his core
Mohamed Serraji got his high school diploma at Les Orangers high school in Rabat, before heading to France to pursue a degree in engineering.
Despite his quite “classic” approach to education so far, Serraji claims he never really imagined a future where he would be working a typical nine-to-five job.
“I always knew I was going to become an entrepreneur. I come from a whole family of entrepreneurs. Our last name ‘Serraji’ is derived from the Arabic word ‘serj’ which means a horse saddle. Our ancestors ran a horse business,” explained the engineer.
In 2003, Serraji began to provide engineering services in Canada, where he was living at the time. “I am very grateful to Canada. It has offered me a lot of opportunities to study and to set up my business,” he said.
The entrepreneur had a vision of creating a solid team that would grow together, creating wealth for each other but also sharing knowledge and expertise with young people who may hold the same passion for engineering and innovation.
Serraji’s journey is an inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners to remain resolute and firm in pursuing their goals.

Moving back to Morocco
When his business started taking off in Canada, the CEO of NTS decided to start a team back in his home country in 2012.
“I came to Morocco because I saw there were many opportunities here. There are many talented people that can learn very fast, and because the life cost in Morocco is very competitive compared to Western Europe and America, we can provide hybrid solutions for our customers to increase our competitiveness,” explained Serraji when asked about his decision to bring his company to Morocco.
The initiative was very well received by shareholders, considering the aeronautics industry in Morocco was in the early stages of development, with few companies operating in the high-demand field.
The main objective of the installation in Morocco was to offer a “best cost” offer to the company’s North American and European clients.
Besides favoring a cost and time effective business, bringing the company to Morocco was also bringing new technology, international expertise and various job opportunities.
“From the start, the ministry of industry was very helpful in helping us set up a team in Morocco. We had very good incentives in terms of training people with ANAPEC (National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Competencies),” said Serraji.
The company’s offices are installed in Bouznika, so as to be close to both Casablanca and Rabat, two of Morocco’s major cities for industrial operations. The location is also favorable for interactions with the significant industrial zone in Nouaceur in the Casablanca-Settat region.
NTS Technics provides services in France as well, maintaining proximity to the leading company’s French and other European clients.
Diversify to succeed
For optimal results, NTS Technics makes it one of its priorities to diversify activities, clients, and industries.
Product diversification strategy typically allows a company to grow by introducing a new product or service into the supply chain, therefore broadening the business’ target and creating opportunity for more successful segments.
By operating in the aeronautics, automotive, rail and naval industries, NTS Technics is able to diversify its customer portfolio, reaching into completely separate industries.
On the other hand, geographical diversification refers to the existence of a company in different locations, setting foot into foreign markets to gain more clients and international ties.
In 2020, NTS Technics, which at the time only operated in three industries -aeronautics, automotive and rail -  decided to open a naval division in Tanja Marina Bay, attracting clients in the major Moroccan port city of Tangier.
“Diversification is part of risk management,” explained Serraji.
A one-of-a-kind client
NTS Technics is currently the only non-Asian company to work with a world-renowned Japanese car manufacturer. In terms of workload, they are the second out of their many suppliers.
In order to maintain the well-renowned Japanese manufacturer as a client, Serraji swears by the following set of skills: creativity, confidence, and problem solving.
The partnership, which is still in place to this day, had its fair share of ups and downs.
“We had a hard patch where the quality was not up to their expectations, so we had to push through and work even harder to meet their demands,” said the CEO of NTS.
The Japanese client requires services which are in conformity with Japanese-level quality, which took much training and determination for the NTS team to reach.
Other clients of the Moroccan company include: Dassault Aviation, Michelin, Stelia Aerospace, Bombardier, and Safran.
The successful CEO ended the exclusive interview with Morocco World News by expressing his desire to “give back to his country.”
For his 2022-2025 development plan, Mohamed Serraji hopes to achieve a number of 300 collaborators, by acquiring new clients in Europe and in Japan and strengthening ties with NTS Technics’ current clients.
“My success is due in great part to the great foundation I got in my country, as well as to the support I receive daily from my great team and my close family members” he asserted.

217,Brazil-Africa Forum Outlines OCP’s Contributions to Brazilian Agriculture,Brazil’s successful experience in boosting its agriculture sector can be replicated in the African continent to combat hunger and boost farmers’ production.,Oumaima Latrech,"Nov. 25, 2021 12:33 p.m.","Rabat – Talks at the 2021 Brazil-Africa forum explored the urgency of deepening and strengthening long-term partnerships between Brazil and the African continent, with many panelists drawing attention to OCP Group’s role in Brazilian agriculture as an inspiring model of Brazilian-African  agriculture cooperation.
Arguing that the African continent saw a noticeable improvement in agriculture due to the implementation of Brazil’s approach in agricultural development, the forum’s participants  shed light on the Brazilian experience and the importance of Morocco’s OCP phosphates in Brazil’s agriculture.
One of the panels of the two-day forum, themed “Helping farmers achieve better results: the Brazilian experience,” focused on finding solutions to help small producers who can’t afford buying the suitable substances and products to make their soil or land more fertile.
The panelists discussed the importance of green energy and phosphate to help farmers, with many pointing out that the revenues of those small producers represent the major part of their total income.
Among the major ideas discussed during the panel was the notion that renewable energies are a great way to combat global warming and help the farmer save money as it can produce electricity for heating, lighting, and fuel for use on the farm, while phosphate is an essential ingredient in all fertilizers.
Highlighting the pivotal role agri-business plays in Brazil, which generates about over a hundred billion dollars, Olavio Takenaka, President of OCP Fertilizantes, commented on OCP’s efforts to help Brazilian companies based on phosphate.
Morocco supplies Brazil with mostly fish, such as sardines, and fertilizers, mostly phosphate or phosphate-based – fertilizer sales amounted to $650 million last year.

Although several companies in Brazil are actively looking for ways to boost their production, the country still depends on imports, with imports of macronutrients reaching over 80%.
“The greatest producer and source of phosphate in the world is Morocco. Brazil imports about 40% of phosphate from Morocco annually,” Takenaka said, adding that Morocco is a natural partner for the Latin American country.
In addition, he went on, Morocco has the world’s largest reserves of phosphate, with some estimates that the country currently holds 50 billion metric tons in reserve, the equivalent of approximately 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves.
A decade ago, phosphate revenues in the country accounted for $4.2 billion in the national purse. The figures increased to approximately $5.7 billion in 2020, marking a nearly 27% increase in the country’s income through phosphate, according to Morocco’s Foreign Exchange Office.
“Ever since Morocco opened its office in Brazil 12 years ago, they have been a great partner who supplied us with what we need in terms of phosphate,” Takenaka said.
Brazil’s efforts to help farmers
Economic globalization has been very important for any sector, some panelists said, arguing that it has increased global trade and led to more competition. In turn, this can spread wealth more equally and boost farmers’ production, they suggested.
As agricultural production grows much faster with globalization, the profit of the agriculture production comes in large scale. The panelists debated over the future of small farmers with no scale who don’t gain much profit.

Roberto Rodrigues, former President of the International Cooperative Alliance and of the Brazilian Cooperatives Organization, stressed that Brazil has created cooperatives to help farmers access fertilizers with a reasonable price.
“The cooperatives make sure that the small farmers buy products they really need. It reduces costs for them. The cooperatives add value,” he said.
For her part, Sueme Mori Andrade from the Brazilian Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock (CNA), emphasized that CNA works with smaller producers and with value chains that aren’t very common in the region such as honey, fishery, and spices. She noted that these value chains have a great importance for Brazilian farmers.
“We represent more than 2 million agriculture producers and we have a very strong agricultural sector,” she said.
Panelists also focused on how to ensure sustainability within the agriculture sector. 
Alexandre Moraes do Amaral, an international strategy advisor to the executive director of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), highlighted the strategies developed by the company to further improve science agriculture and agricultural practices that are sustainable and based on scientific research and technological innovation.
“EMBRAPA’s major contribution to Brazilian agriculture is something that can be replicated in the African continent very easily while focusing on sustainability along the way,” he commented.
The panel also shed light on “tropicalism,” with Amaral arguing that action taken in the past helped Brazil to improve its agriculture.
He spoke about the tropicalization of products such as plant-based or animal-based products as well as the contribution of these products to the enrichment of the Brazilian ecosystems.
“Tropicalization also contributed to the development of a sustainable production platform that involved the private sector and the Brazilian agriculture and universities,” Amaral underlined, highlighting that science-based sustainability is “the greatest contribution that EMBRAPA has given to Brazil.”
He explained, “In the 60s and 70s, soybeans in Brazil were planted in the southern area of the country.” However, due to technological advances and the constant innovation of research centers, “the cultivation of soybeans started to expand to central and western areas of Brazil.”
Recalling social concerns raised in many countries about food during the COVID crisis, CNA’s Andrade stressed that “30% of Brazil’s exports consist of soybeans.”
She alluded to the global panic that greeted the first weeks of the COVID crisis as countries faced the challenge of guaranteeing food supplies for their populations amid an unprecedented worldwide lockdown.  
“Last year during the pandemic, many countries reached out to CNA wondering whether Brazil would put any food restrictions on exports,” she said. “No country is self-sufficient, [even though] in Brazil, we have resilient food production.”

Brazil got to where it is today thanks to investments in science, technology, entrepreneurship, Rodrigues said, adding that the country kept growing even after the world’s crisis thanks to its sustainability.
“Nobody expected Brazil to flourish over ten years and become an agricultural powerhouse,” OCP’s Olavio Takenaka underlined.
He continued, “We hope to cooperate not only with Morocco but with EMBRAPA and other cooperatives as well. I think the partnership between Brazil and Morocco is very important due to the strategies that both countries have.”

218,EU Strengthens ‘Equal’ Migration Partnership with Morocco,Europeans’ concerns over rising waves of irregular migration have consolidated Morocco’s bargaining power in an uneven partnership with the EU.,Saadia Dinia,"Nov. 20, 2021 8:59 p.m.","Rabat - The European Commission’s action plan on migration, leaked earlier last month, reveals a shift in the EU’s cooperation with Morocco on irregular mobility. The document mainly highlights the Commission’s readiness to put to work its new Pact on Migration and Asylum as Europe looks to make tangible progress on the migration management front.
Over the past decade, the evolution of migration patterns has progressively turned Morocco into a versatile space where various forms of mobility come together and criss-cross. Today, Morocco is no longer a space of emigration and transit only; the Cherifian Kingdom has become a stopover and a country of destination, too. 
This means the country has gradually emerged as a space of settlement, return and re-settlement for many migrants and asylum seekers from more than 48 countries (mostly sub-Saharan Africa and Syria). Currently, Morocco’s migrant populations are living in more than 70 localities throughout the territory. 
The government’s National Strategy for Immigration and Asylum (SNIA), launched in 2013, and Morocco’s collaboration with the UNHCR have propelled the Kingdom as “a reference country” in terms of promotion of local integration opportunities for displaced people. Under SNIA, the UNHCR is able to deliver protection services which facilitate access to national services, such as education and primary health care, thus achieving “concrete results.” 
Read also: The Complex Lives of Sub-Saharan Migrants in Morocco
Such internal developments in migration governance combined with increasingly militarized EU external borders account for the consistent increase in the number of registered refugees and asylum seekers in Morocco over the past years. In 2020, for instance, the UNHCR communicated an increase of nearly 30% of people of concern hosted in Morocco, when compared to 2019.
According to this year’s report, the UNHCR indicates that the number of irregular migrants hosted in Morocco (as of September 21) amounts to 15,755 individuals. 8,853 of them are refugees and 6,902 others are asylum seekers. They are mostly Syrians (4,914), followed by Guineans (2,134), Ivorians (1,297), Cameroonians (1,166), and Yemenites (1,076). 
This new reality has undoubtedly been a game changer in Morocco-EU relationship not only over issues of migration and mobility but across a wide array of questions as varied as trade relations, investment, development or fostering green and climate action. In other words, it has consolidated Morocco’s bargaining power in an uneven partnership. 
Now clearly recognizing Morocco as a multifunctional space in its opening statement, the EU Commission’s draft recommends that “a partnership of equals” be implemented with Morocco “through dialogue, responsibility sharing, mutual trust, and respect.” It highlights Morocco as “a major partner in the Southern Neighborhood” and describes Morocco-EU cooperation on migration as “solid and long-standing.” 
Certainly, the new Pact on Migration and Asylum proposed in September 2020 is the newest of a long series of EU protocols involving Morocco as a regional leading partner in the Union’s ultimate goal of securitizing its external borders against irregular migration.

What you need to know about the new pact
Mainly, the Commission’s draft reiterates its consideration of Morocco as a “key partner” in a “shared challenge” to prevent and tackle irregular migration as well as to counter the smuggling of migrants for the purpose of “saving lives” and “promoting sustainable and safe legal pathways” to those in need of protection.   
It proposes to achieve these objectives via: 1) Sustained support to Morocco in the fields of migration governance and management; 2) Further engagement of Morocco with the EU’s border control agencies; and 3) Renewed joint efforts addressing the root causes of migration from Morocco.
The document outlines a number of improved and faster procedures and describes progress in their implementation as “key.” 
On migration governance and management
The Commission offers to provide “operational support and capacity building” to the Moroccan National Migration and Asylum Strategy (SNIA). However, it stresses the need for “Morocco’s reinforced commitment” to implement pending legislation on asylum and human trafficking, while commending the country’s “exemplary” cooperation with the UNHCR.
In light of Ceuta’s events last May, the Commission also shows concerns over “possible weaknesses” in cooperation and counts on Morocco’s “enhanced efforts” in “preventing irregular departures, including by Moroccan citizens.” 
In this respect, the draft notes that 6319 Moroccans are reported to have illegally crossed the EU’s external borders this year (as of July 31). In 2020, the number of Moroccans arriving to the EU illegally stood at 17,121, and at 8020 in 2019. The most common migration routes for Moroccans seeking to reach Europe remain the Western Mediterranean Route (from Morocco to Spain via the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla) and the Western African route (from Morocco to Spain via the Canary Islands). 
A total of 5,365 Moroccan nationals were ordered to leave the EU in the first quarter of this year. Meanwhile, 33,645 Moroccans were expelled in the whole of 2020, compared to 34,750 in 2019. Spain, France, and Belgium are the countries with the highest numbers of Moroccan nationals ordered to return to their country of origin, the document indicates. 
In this regard, the Commission wants to revive dialogue with Morocco on the readmission of its nationals who are irregularly residing in the EU, as well as on the reception of third country nationals who transited to Europe through Moroccan territory. 
The EU Commission received a mandate to negotiate an EU Readmission Agreement (EURA) with Morocco in 2003. The last relevant negotiation round took place in 2015 and was suspended by Morocco. The Political dialogue was re-established in 2019 but has seen little progress, according to the Commission. In turn, the Commission's draft proposal stresses the need for “the relaunch of parallel negotiations on readmission and visa facilitation agreements.” 
Since the readmission of third country nationals is “a red line” for Morocco, the EU’s linking between the two dossiers of readmission and visa facilitation is part of an older strategy of resorting to “a fine balance of incentives and pressure,” remarks Tasnim Abderrahim, visiting fellow at the European Institute of the Mediterranean. This approach, using the more-for-more principle, seeks to propel North African countries into stronger cooperation on the question of migrant return.

On cooperation with EU border control agencies
In its newly planned pact, the Commission shows appreciation for Morocco “providing a model others [in the region] may follow” in terms of cooperation with the EU’s border control agencies. It manifests particular interest in deepening Rabat’s cooperation with these agencies.
As such, it invites Morocco to sign a roadmap of joint activities for 2021-2022 with FRONTEX, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. It is also organizing a forthcoming “high-level” visit of Moroccan officials to EUROPOL, the EU’s top agency for handling criminal intelligence and combating international organized crime, to strengthen cooperation. 
While Morocco’s involvement with FRONTEX dates back to the early 2000s, often earning it the nickname of “Europe’s policeman,” the kingdom’s increasing reality as a transit country for victims and perpetrators of forced displacement is no good news for the EU. In this respect, the Commission urges Morocco to consolidate its dismantling operations of smuggling networks as well as its search and rescue capacities. 
Informal dialogue with the Moroccan General Directorate for National Security (DGSN) on this subject is to be confirmed in the coming months, indicates the Commission’s draft. Talks on the possibility of an Anti-Smuggling Operational Morocco-EU Partnership are also being programmed. 
Ongoing corresponding actions, shows the draft, are the EU’s Common Operational Partnership (COP) in Africa against Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking in Human Beings funded until 2022 from the EU budget under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). 
Possibilities for a more structured cooperation between Morocco and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) are also being explored. On this subject, based on provisional data from EASO, first time asylum applications by Moroccan nationals in the EU amounted to 9530 this year (as of September 12). 47% of these applications were lodged in Spain, 12% in Austria, and 11% in Italy. 
Last year, 6,775 applications for asylum in the EU were made by Moroccan nationals, down from 8950 in 2019. With rising applications for asylum in the Union, reports EASO, Morocco is now among the 10 main origin countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. 
Relatedly, the European Court of Auditors’ 2021 special report on EU readmission cooperation with third countries indicates that Morocco is second among the 10 third countries with the most non-returned irregular migrants during the 2014-2018 period (excluding Syria). Morocco is strikingly sandwiched between Afghanistan and Pakistan in this list (Point 24 in the report). 
Making this trend particularly concerning is that such a sharp rise in the numbers of Moroccan asylum seekers places the country abreast of war-torn countries such as Afghanistan or Syria. This point leads us to the third section of the Commission’s draft attempting to address the root causes of migration from and towards Morocco.

The root causes of irregular migration
The Commission wishes to further address the root causes of irregular departures from Morocco of both Moroccans and third country nationals settled in the country or transiting from it towards Europe. While not explicitly mentioned in the document being reviewed, this point is however important to keep in mind.   
To do that, the Commission proposes to deploy a wide range of policy tools. The suggested measures aim to support Morocco in “a resilient and sustainable post-crisis economic recovery,” “to develop entrepreneurship,” “to create jobs,” and “to improve social protection and better access to public services,” via a multi-stakeholder approach. In addition to explaining these points,  the draft mentions that the relevant budget for the 2021-2027 period is under preparation. 
Past undertakings in this regard, notes the new action plan, include support to the migration legislative and institutional framework to promote social inclusion at the local level through enhancing employability of both returned Moroccans and the migrants living in Morocco. An $8 million project implemented by the Belgian Development Agency (ENABEL) under the 2018-2022 EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF).
Another initiative was the support of the Moroccan diaspora’s creation of economic activities and employment opportunities in Morocco. Of this, one relevant example was the second phase of the MEET Africa project, implemented by Expertise France  with a budget of $3 million and under the 2019-2019 EUTF initiative. In this respect, the new action plan encourages Moroccan efforts on increased engagement of the diaspora, in particular with regards “to productive investments in Morocco.”
Yet other initiatives mentioned in the reviewed document were the support of civil society in Morocco, ($2.3 million) under EUTF (2019-2022), to provide direct coordinated assistance to migrants; and support to the South-South cooperation between Morocco, Mali, Senegal and the Ivory Coast on migration and development. A project executed by GIZ and Expertise France with an envelope of 9$ million under EUTF (2019-2022) as well.
This phase also entails a $40 million support program aimed at improving migration governance in Morocco, including supporting SNIA in its mission to help migrants integrate in the Kingdom. An additional envelope of $1.7 million, to the national asylum commission, is expected by the end of this year to complement these efforts.
The EU’s second largest cooperation portfolio on migration is with Morocco with a total of $425 million, of which $273 million is drawn from the North Africa window of EUTF. The EU also remains the biggest contributor of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Morocco, as part of the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) scheme. Besides, the 2018 EU External Investment Plan sought to leverage private funds to tackle unemployment as a root cause of migration.
However, it is worth mentioning that between 2014 and 2020, only 7.5% of the EU portfolio on migration with Morocco was allocated for socio-economic integration purposes. 11% of the budget was dedicated to migrants’ protection measures, while 80% was allotted to institutional support and border management, as specified in the Commission’s action plan. 
Still, it remains Morocco’s own responsibility to address the reasons why thousands of its nationals continue to attempt crossing the sea towards Europe every year. Similarly, the EU Commission’s draft proposal also urges the Moroccan government to take meaningful steps in terms of providing protection and dignifying living conditions to the constantly rising numbers of refugees and asylum seekers settling in Morocco. 
But the EU’s new pact on migration and asylum is far from a “new,” groundbreaking document on migration management. Nor is is a “fresh start,” as it was described when first released in September 2020 - at least not as regards its planned partnership with Morocco.

Certainly, the new pact recognizes Morocco’s bolstered bargaining power on the questions of migration and asylum, hence calling for a “mutually beneficial” partnership of “equals” to be initiated. However, more or less the same logic as in earlier cooperation on migration still pertains between both partners: A relationship governed by a “more for more” principle, where Morocco is rewarded with more support programs when it takes more steps to securitize EU external borders. 
As such, the EU Commission's draft proposal sets the new contours of is a “successful” migration governance which has managed to drastically decrease the number of migrants attempting to cross to Europe since 2018, at the expense of migrants' lives as well as serious humanitarian breaches on both sides of the partnership.

219,Algeria Parades Former Opposition Leaders to Accuse Morocco,Leadership in Algiers appears to have forced two former opposition leaders out of retirement to join in its propaganda efforts.,Jasper Hamann,"Nov. 04, 2021 12:55 p.m.","Rabat - Leadership in Algiers appears to have forced two former opposition leaders out of retirement to join in its propaganda efforts. Former rivals of the Algerian regime, Soufiane Djilali and Abdelkader Bengrina, both conveniently decided to issue sudden statements following the unconfirmed attack.
Following the fresh round of Algerian accusations, domestic media published two eerily similar statements about former political rivals of Algiers suddenly “breaking the silence” to condemn Morocco, and support the regime that they have routinely condemned in the past.
Former rivals “speak out”
Announcing that “Soufiane Djilali comes out of his long silence,” Algerian media published and commented on a statement by the former political opponent who in recent years has changed into a pro-regime commentator. 
Djilali in recent years has pivoted from being a vocal supporter of the Hirak protests, to celebrating the widely boycotted new constitution as constituting the emergence of a “new Algeria” that fulfilled the Hirak’s demands.
Both Djilali and many in the Algerian populace clearly understand these words are not that of Djilali, but instead originated from “the power,” as Algerians call their opaque clique of political and military leaders. Parroting exact phrases pushed by the aging Algerian regime, few saw his statements as anything but evidence of his acquiescence after years of opposition.
In 2019, Djilali as Chairman of the Jil Jadid party rejected the elections that saw current President Abdelmadjid Tebboune emerge as the de-facto heir to former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Ever since, Djilali appears to have “bent the knee” to the regime he repeatedly described as despotic, issuing several pro-regime statements.
Algiers used Djilali in its efforts to legitimize its widely boycotted constitutional referendum, forcing him to proclaim the unpopular reforms meant the realization of the Hirak’s demands, even as its followers roundly mocked the political theater.
Political lackeys
Algeria’s regime again used Djilali’s rapidly deteriorating reputation as a truth teller this week as he conveniently decided to come out of retirement to rally the population in support of the regime he long opposed.  
Djilali barely made an effort to conceal the nature of his message, instead choosing to parrot Algiers’ message nearly verbatim. He pointed to Morocco’s “expansionist desire” as evidence for the accusations.
A nearly identical message came from Abdelkader Bengrina, a politician who ran against Tebboune in the 2019 elections. Similar to Djilali, Bengrine chose to spontaneously “break his silence” and push the regime’s messaging. 
As with Djilali, Algiers appears to be pushing its former rival to urge Algerians to focus on perceived foreign foes, instead of the country's economic woes. 
Amid rising food prices, water shortages in the capital and a structural economic crisis, Bengrina chose to finally speak up, not on Algeria’s crippling crises, but instead to support the regime’s messaging and denounce Morocco’s “cowardly, despicable and contemptible aggression.” 
It appears that Algiers is hoping for a renewed sense of national unity by parading two former rivals in front of the national media’s cameras and having them parrot the government’s warmongering narrative. 
The nearly identical statements, issued in a nearly identical way, shows a clear and amateuristic attempt to bring opponents of Algeria’s regime into the fold and silence internal debates on the country’s crises.
A pattern of propaganda
Following the emergence of Algerian accusations of a Moroccan strike on three Algerian nationals, Algiers appears to aim to unify the population by forcing its former political opposition to present a  mock “unified front” against Morocco.
Algeria’s state press agency stirred up further tensions with Morocco this week by publishing a statement that accused Morocco of a “barbaric bombardment” targeting two Algerian truck drivers and their local guide. 
Algerian news outlets did not report on the issue however, instead they all published the government statement nearly word for word. The sudden lack of editorial creativity evident on Algerian media’s front pages appears to show decision-makers in Algiers ensured all media would push the exact same message aimed at the Algerian population.
As seen in other similar cases in recent months, Algeria’s leadership has only one message: Algerians should ignore their domestic crises and unify against a foreign threat. 
Algeria has grasped at straws to justify its renewed belligerence against Morocco, accusing its western neighbor of a “zionist conspiracy theory” that caused local wildfires. 
The accusations came amid dozens of similar wildfires on the same day across the Mediterranean coast of Europe and North Africa. Algerian police investigations quickly concluded that a group of minors had been the source of the blaze, yet Algiers continued to present the natural disaster as a devious foreign plot by its political opponents.
Victimizing Algerians
The unfortunate side effect of Algiers’ efforts to distract and galvanize the population is an artificial diplomatic crisis at a time when dialogue and cooperation is most needed. The regime continues to be a prime example of what Karl Marx described as “bonapartism,” showing a shift to authoritarian rule following a popular revolution, by using the co-option of the revolution’s ideals.
Algeria’s elite has shown it has no problem turning the deaths of dozens of victims of wildfires into political tools, as weapons aimed at its own population. 
It should be no surprise, therefore, that the unfortunate demise of three Algerian nationals this week was immediately used to attempt to create a faux moment of unity, conveniently occuring on Algeria’s independence day. 
What Algeria’s regime cannot answer, and won’t let its media ask, is one crucial question: What does Morocco have to gain from allegedly bombing two civilian Algerian trucks? A related question might be: After months of attempts to de-escalate tensions with Algeria, why would Rabat suddenly break years of peace by attacking Algerian civilians?
Instead of investigating and mourning the deaths of three citizens, Algeria’s decision-makers saw a convenient opportunity to again attempt to distract Algerians from their economic plight.
Algeria’s leadership attempted to trigger a similar artificial crisis in May, by suddenly expelling Moroccan farmers from their land near Figuig. Morocco chose to recognize Algeria’s decision as a sovereign choice, in order to reduce tensions. Since then, Morocco has made repeated overtures for peace and dialogue, which have all been ignored by Algiers.
Algeria’s regime continues to need the appearance of conflict between Morocco and Algeria, as it has few solutions on offer for its restless population. Time and again, citizens of both nations become the victims of these amateuristic attempts to spark bilateral tensions. 
Playing with fire
Algeria’s regime has few solutions on offer for the deep structural crises the country is facing. 
The country’s pseudo military-leadership appears to have only one final straw to grasp at, by likening today’s artificial stand-off with Morocco as part of the country’s independence struggle.
Algeria’s regime cheapens the legacies of the thousands who died and millions who valiantly struggled to rid the country of France’s imperial presence. That legendary zeal and commitment is now being reduced to empty propaganda targeted at a fellow African state. 
Decision-makers in Algiers count on what 19th century philosopher Gustave LeBon described as the unconscious irrationality of crowds, of its power to make people conform to the group opinion facing a common goal or threat. 
Yet, Algeria’s aging leadership fails to recognize that in the age of the internet, their efforts are as transparent as they are ineffective. Few will see Algiers’ accusations as the rallying cry it is hoping for. 
Still, Algeria’s leaders continue to play with fire, risking to accidentally trigger a real conflict. Algiers is making a mockery of the pan-African ideals to create continental peace and stability. It is casting aside efforts by European and Arab League partners to mediate.  In its twisted quest for national survival, Algeria’s bonapartist regime is focusing only on its own political survival.
Worse of all, Algeria’s leaders appear willing to risk regional instability, impoverish their own people, undermine Maghrebi unity and cheapen the unfortunate deaths of its citizens with amateuristic political theater, all in a blatant effort to stay in power, all else be damned.

220,"Is ‘Morocco Now’ a New Moroccan Standard, or Just Marketing?",Morocco unveiled its new “Morocco Now” brand with great fanfare at the Dubai Expo 2020 last week.,Jasper Hamann,"Oct. 23, 2021 5:55 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco used the global platform of the Expo 2020 in Dubai last week to launch “Morocco Now,” an investment brand that holds much promise, and elicits even more questions. 
The marketing blitz that accompanied the launch of the “Morocco Now” brand was hard to miss. The campaign was not only one of the show-stealing presentations at the Dubai Expo, but also featured on iconic landmarks such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and Times Square in New York City.
The investment brand quickly became a topic for discussion, featuring on CNN as well as various regional media outlets. Much has since been said about the investment brand, yet the devil remains in the details. The question remains whether Morocco Now will constitute a new Moroccan standard of doing business, or whether it simply sells Morocco’s existing investment opportunities.
Marketing stunt?
The launch of Morocco’s new investment brand was accompanied by all the slickly-produced marketing material one expects to see from a multinational giant or corporate brand. Morocco Now’s branding was clearly intended to grab global attention at a global expo where every country aimed to dazzle others with their unique economic opportunities.
For Morocco, the expo was a moment to display the accomplishments that the North African country has achieved over the last two decades. Ever since the crowning of King Mohammed VI, the country has been going through a radical new development plan that is evident across the country.
The first thing a visitor crossing the strait of Gibraltar sees when approaching the coast of the bustling port city of Tangier are the hills, covered in windmills. From the very northern tip of the country, to the desert landscape of its southern border with Mauritania, green energy has become a symbol of the country’s new development.
While Morocco still faces several structural issues regarding inequality, education, healthcare, corruption, poverty and gender issues, the country has clearly undertaken a new approach that aligns neatly with international standards regarding climate change, sustainable business, and a favorable business environment.
Morocco Now seizes on these two decades of development, presenting Morocco as a place where business can thrive while ensuring climate priorities and value chains are weaved into every business opportunity. 
Yet, within two weeks of the brand’s launch, its website now offers few details, promising only that a “new version” of the website is “coming soon.” After a successful launch, the question remains, what will Morocco Now really do?
New Moroccan Standard?
While Morocco Now emphasizes the country’s rapid development, it builds on this by promising four key factors that make Morocco “a reliable place to invest.” It describes the country as a “future proof industrial platform” that offers a certain standard to all foreign investors. 
Those standards rely on the four pillars of Morocco Now, promising that all investments are sustainable, competitive, proven, and agile. 
The brand emphasizes that Morocco has shown its agility amid the COVID-19 crisis, while it has a proven track record on mega projects, attracting foreign investment and making domestic investment in education.
It highlights Morocco’s competitive industry, offering low labor costs and highly competitive container fees for export. The country’s 54 free trade agreements makes it a “gateway to be part of Africa’s fast growth potential,” the program emphasizes.
Morocco Now itself describes the brand as an “identity” and as such it can be assumed the brand primarily aims to encapsulate the driving factors behind Morocco’s recent development blitz. The brand aims to describe Morocco’s attractive investment opportunities for international investors, without offering any new direction for domestic enterprises.
While Morocco Now’s website refurbishment could indicate the brand is now shifting to a domestic audience to ensure its pillars remain at the core of Moroccan business, only time will tell what this means in terms of tangible impact.
National project
It appears that Morocco Now is a brand that doesn’ only promote the country’s recent development, but additionally banks on the successful implementation of its new economic development model. 
The four pillars that the Morocco Now identity is based on appears to neatly align with the development model’s promise of a “prosperous, skilled, inclusive, and sustainable” economy.
It additionally appears that, in many ways, Morocco Now is simply a rebranding of the basic tenets of the new economic model mixed with an overview of Morocco’s past two decades of development.
In itself, the new development model (NMD) is nothing short of a structurally bold plan. Yet Morocco Now’s own assessment of its NMD-inspired projections  does in fact make the “Morocco Now” launch something of a marketing stunt instead of a bold new direction for domestic audiences. 
To its credit, however, Morocco Now has generated significant buzz, and directed attention towards Morocco’s promising economic development and excited international trade prospects. 
If the idea behind the project was indeed to communicate the national development strategy’s main ideas to foreign investors, the project appears to be a success. If not, the coming update to the website can hopefully further clarify the extent to which Morocco Now is aiming to impact domestic business practices.
Following the positive reception of the Morocco Now initiative, Morocco can take comfort in the merits of its new development model, and the promise it holds to not just improve Moroccan lives, but also invite foreign investors to invest in Morocco’s future promise. 
Morocco is continuing to mature as a hub for trade and business, and Morocco Now appears to be another step in that direction. But there are still lingering questions and concerns that need to be settled - and the sooner, the better.
Morocco Now is arguably a more approachable and “sexy” brand than the rather technocratic sounding “new development model.” Morocco’s new model does deserve international attention, and if a simple marketing exercise can accomplish such a feat, so be it.

221,Internal Crises Prompt New Algerian Accusations Toward Morocco,"As Algeria’s government runs out of solutions to address the country’s spiralling crises, the only option left is to further raise tensions with Morocco.",Jasper Hamann,"Oct. 22, 2021 10:51 a.m.","Rabat - Algeria’s government is facing heavy internal pressure, leading it to direct attention away from domestic issues, and towards Morocco. 
On the day after former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s brother   announced he knew “secrets that could shake the state,” current President Abdelmadjid Tebboune again escalated his accusations towards Morocco.
Following controversy amid Said Bouteflika’s trial, Tebboune chose to further raise tensions with Morocco, as the Algerian government appears to have few solutions left besides blaming its Western neighbor.

Domestic controversy
Instead of addressing the “great secrets” that the former president’s brother  highlighted during his trial, Tebboune instead chose to again use his ongoing strategy of diversionary foreign policy. As has become common in crisis-riddled Algeria, the government is directing the attention of an angry populace at Morocco, instead of addressing the issues at hand.
Algeria’s government appears to have few solutions left to solve the country’s issues. 
In the past, the government would use the country’s oil and gas riches to introduce new subsidies, grants, and scholarships. This time however, the national purse cannot support such popular measures. Instead, subsidies on vital cooking oil are actually reduced, highlighting the precarious state of Algerian finances.
Yet, President Tebboune’s public remarks focus less on the country’s structural economic woes, or political controversies, instead Tebboune is again lobbying accusations westward. Instead of genuinely addressing the threat of forest fires or punishing the mob who lynched activist Djamel Bensmail, the tragedies are turned into political weapons.

Redirecting attention
This time, Tebboune used his October 13 speech on public television to accuse local Kabylie activists of being “terrorists” in the employ of Morocco. Algeria’s unpopular leader claimed he had “irrefutable evidence” of Morocco’s involvement in the Kabyle movement’s activities.
Those alleged activities included purposefully setting alight vast swaths of Algerian forests. Out of over a dozen wildfires had occurred around the Mediterranean at the time of Algeria’s wildfires, yet those in Algeria are supposed to have been caused by a vast conspiracy theory that involves both Morocco and Israel.
The remarkable politicization of such a national tragedy reveals not just the desperate measures the country’s government is resorting to. It also shows the amateuristic nature of the entire operation. Meanwhile, blaming Morocco for forest fires hampers any effort to reduce naturally occurring blazes, just as domestic economic troubles remain unaddressed.

Amateuristic accusations
Algeria’s aging leadership clearly has not yet accounted fully for the power of the internet. Shortly after Tebboune claimed to have three confessions from “terrorists” that implicated Morocco, it became clear the three men involved are connected to Algerian intelligence.
All three men were shown by Algerian activists to be either directly employed by Algerian intelligence, or directly related to intelligence officers. 
The alleged ringleader of the plot, Elmam Makhlouf, is a former local political candidate that was involved in undermining the local Kabyle candidate. The second “witness” is Cheref Tahar, a former security officer at Algeria’s embassy in Berlin; while the third accused “terrorist,” Kemal Chetti, served as secretary for the environment within the Kabyle movement and is the elder sibling of two Algerian police officers. 
Ferhat Mehenni, the president of the Kabyle self-determination movement (MAK), took to  Twitter to deny all accusations, writing that “the Algerian regime's propaganda machine has just served gullible minds with a new episode of nonsense.” 
Mehenni called for an international “commission of inquiry” to counter the misinformation. “The Algerian regime is trying to demonize Kabylia and the MAK in order to kill any questioning of its disastrous management,” Mehenni analyzed.
While Algerian authorities claimed to have 17 alleged “terrorists” in custody, only three of the accused were presented to the public. The remaining 14 names remain a carefully guarded state secret, further bringing into question the veracity of the government’s amateuristic conspiracy theory in which even the accused cannot be publicly known..
The “witnesses” presented by Tebboune also discredit hundreds of local police investigations that found local juveniles as a source of the devastating blazes that claimed 90 lives.

A convenient distraction
The fact that the government is clumsily presenting easily-refutable “evidence” won’t shock many in Algeria, as the government even discredits international rankings and statistics. 
Prime Minister Aymen Benabderrahmane on October 20 publicly tasked Algeria’s National Statistics Council (CNS) with literally creating “alternative facts”  to counter those offered by international auditors. 
Accusing international rankings of often placing Algeria “in positions which do not reflect the level of development of the country,” Benabderrahmane tasked the CNS with solving this “problem.”
Algeria’s government continues to present easily-disproved evidence for a plot that is ridiculous from its inception. Out of all the forest fires in the Mediterranean region, why would only one be part of a shadowy plot, conveniently plotted by Algeria’s favored foreign boogeymen?
The true answer continues to lie in Algeria’s inability to resolve its structural crises. Despite skyrocketing oil and gas prices, the IMF continues to see Algeria’s economy as “fragile,” with economic opportunities for Algerians unlikely to improve amid rising inflation.
Such deep economic woes are difficult to address. What is much easier however, is to simply accuse Morocco of shadowy plots regarding a devastating national tragedy, and hope public anger is directed at a foreign foe, instead of decision-makers in Algiers.

222,Why Morocco Is Right to Focus on Building Its Strategic Reserves,"Amid a global supply chain crisis, strategic reserves are a key tool to limit the impact of volatile markets.",Jasper Hamann,"Oct. 21, 2021 10:51 a.m.","Rabat - The world is facing a chain supply crisis that could last months, if not several years, precipitating a renewed interest in building up national strategic reserves. That need was recognized by King Mohammed VI who, in his speech marking the opening of parliament, called for a new approach to manage Morocco’s strategic reserves.
The remark received little media attention, yet it tasks the government with establishing a new “integrated national system” to manage vast strategic reserves. The king emphasized the need for reserves to cover “essential goods and products, especially in the areas of food, health and energy.”
The new integrated national system to manage Morocco’s strategic reserves comes at a time when global supply chains are shaken to an extent rarely seen in peace-time. Shortages of containers, truck drivers, mechanical parts and port staff are resulting in a vicious cycle of ever-more precarious supply chains around the world.
The UK has faced warnings that shelves might not be stocked around Christmas time while the US is heavily impacted by record gas prices and shortages, as its reliance on foreign suppliers becomes a liability. While much of the headlines on shortages focus on Europe’s gas supply crisis ahead of a cold winter, staple products are starting to disappear from otherwise stocked supermarket isles.
Supply chain crisis
The ongoing global supply chain crisis started taking shape when the global economy surged following a disastrous year caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As businesses and customers recovered from a difficult year, fragile global supply chains started to strain. 
Most businesses around the world rely on steady deliveries of foreign products for their production and distribution, and in recent years storing reserves of such products in warehouses was increasingly seen as an unnecessary cost. 
Increased efficiency in global supply chains saw businesses instead work with a “Just-in-Time” inventory system that depends on products arriving just when they are needed, reducing the need - and cost - of storing goods in warehouses. While this system is highly efficient, the current crisis is providing ample evidence of the system’s lack of resilience under suboptimal conditions.
The integrated nature of our supply chains mean that one small hitch in the chain can reverberate through the system and even create a vicious circle that is hard to stop. 
In the US, for example, distributors are facing a shortage of truck drivers and the parts needed to repair broken trucks. Because the parts needed to fix trucks come from China, delivery can take weeks or months instead of days. This reduces the number of trucks available, slowing down deliveries further, in an ever worsening cycle.
National strategic reserves
In order to ensure that citizens do not go without the most basic necessities of life, most governments around the world manage “strategic reserves,” by stockpiling these products. 
Once stockpiled, the government can use these supplies in two ways. Firstly, it reserves for emergencies, such as war or natural disasters. More commonly, reserves are used to stabilize prices of staple products by managing supply to meet domestic demand.
Oil and gas are the most common strategic reserves held by governments as a way to control the price and supply of vital energy. Superpowers such as the US and China hold vast reserves that they can use to stabilize pricing. When hydrocarbon prices are low, governments typically fill their reserves, allowing them to offload part of these reserves when prices rise.
This fundamental process was interrupted in Europe amid the COVID-19 crisis, and the bloc is now desperately refilling its reserves ahead of what is predicted to be a very cold winter.
But energy is only one part of strategic reserves. Russia stockpiles vast amounts of wheat, China has reserves of frozen pork, while Canada even stockpiles maple syrup.  
Over the past decades countries have increasingly favored short-term profits over building reserves, a trend that has culminated in the current crisis. Without national reserves, countries are vulnerable to price swings in the global market, which is on full display in the current global supply chain crisis. 
A regional issue
Facing insufficient supply while demand remains high, countries around the world are bracing for potential shortages. From semiconductor chips used in anything from household appliances to cars and industrial equipment, to beloved products such as toys, wine and Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, supplies are running low.
While a lack of ice-cream might not be as much of a problem as Europe’s lack of gas to heat homes during a cold winter, there is one strategic reserve that any government is wise to stock up on: food. 
Rising food prices have a tremendous impact on domestic stability. Rises in bread prices alone have been linked to revolutions from the 1789 French Revolution, to the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Building food reserves is a smart way of preventing domestic unrest.
The foresight to stockpile food stuff is however not always a given. Egypt holds reserves of five months-worth of domestic consumption of wheat and cooking oil, while its neighbor Sudan, which has no such reserves, is facing shortages already, because its main port is blocked.
Prioritizing ample reserves is important, especially in the MENA region. A 2017 report for the World Bank Economic Review warned that “the combination of diets heavily reliant on wheat and wheat supplies dependent on imports means that events in global wheat markets play an outsized role for welfare outcomes in the region.”
Market volatility, the report predicted, would see major vulnerabilities for oil-importing countries such as Lebanon and Jordan, as well as less-developed oil exporters such as Iraq, Yemen and Syria. 
More developed Gulf countries import most of their food, yet can cover for increased food prices as those prices typically increase alongside oil prices, increasing national revenue. 
“Egypt and Morocco do not have the luxury of ample fiscal space to absorb sustained higher prices, although their higher domestic production levels help cushion price shocks,” the report stated.
Morocco’s strategic reserves
While Morocco has a thriving agricultural sector, the country’s lack of water means it imports some of its most important food products. Some of the most common items on a Moroccan table come from abroad, including mostly Russian-bought wheat for its bread, and Chinese gunpowder tea for its iconic mint tea.
King Mohammed VI’s directive to better manage and build reserves covering “food, health and energy,” comes at a crucial time for the Moroccan economy. 
Morocco is predicted to have a good cereals harvest in 2021, following several drought-stricken years of diminished yields. The new “integrated national system” will likely be tasked with providing ample storage capacity to build reserves for times when yields are less plentiful. 
Conversely, Morocco faces reduced imports of natural gas amid a diplomatic dispute with its gas-rich neighbor Algeria. According to Rystadt Energy, Algerian gas accounts for 12% of Morocco’s electricity production, a number that has been in gradual decline over the years.
New economic partnerships with hydrocarbon-giant Nigeria, and domestic gas exploration are hoped to cushion the impact of the spat with Algeria. Yet Morocco additionally needs gas to produce one of its most-wanted exports - phosphate fertilizers. The development of “green hydrogen” as an alternative is offered as a long-term solution.
Morocco’s solutions are showing foresight, yet require years to develop. In the meantime, building up vast gas reserves is likely the only short-term solution to limit vulnerabilities to global price swings such as the current surge in prices for natural gas. 
The monarch’s call to consider “national needs” as part of the “country’s strategic security,” comes at an opportune time. The supply chain crisis will provide apt motivation to spur on lawmakers, and treat the country’s strategic reserves as the national priority that it is.
Morocco’s role as a prime source of stability and economic growth in the region depends on these reserves. The country has to limit its exposure to what could be a years-long supply chain crisis, while the effects of climate change will have a growing impact on its prospects. 
As the king highlighted, Morocco has adequately managed its supply issues during the pandemic, now it needs to be ready to weather the storm of the tumultuous years ahead of us.

223,Morocco’s Economy on Track Despite Tumultuous Regional Climate,"As the MENA region grapples with the COVID-19 crisis, Morocco continues to make dynamic economic moves in the region but must push further past the edge of the envelope.",Alec Hunter Stimac,"Oct. 20, 2021 9:31 a.m.","The economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remains evident in numerous sectors across most economies in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. 
Although the MENA region should rebound in oil prices and stronger external demand with less economically disruptive new outbreaks toward the end of 2021, it is still to be seen which countries will be positive economic players for the region going into 2022. 
This uncertainty about the region’s prospects is even more manifest as the majority of the Middle East is under a lot of stress beyond the parameters of COVID’s shadow.
To begin with, after the Biden administration instructed US troops to abandon their mission in Iraq by the end of the year and initiate a full withdrawal from Afghanistan, the question of MENA’s posture in the global economy began to stir up, regardless of the public health of any particular country. Afghanistan itself has been mired in an acute economic crisis since the Taliban took control, with no sight of light in the near future. 
Ultimately, countries further away from the political strife in the Eastern parts of the MENA region, such as Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and others will have the most potential for growth with less crisis coming their way from Afghanistan. And while countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel continue to boost high GDP figures, this fall is a perfect time for medium sized economies to make a substantial move up the rankings if they decide to use this window of opportunity properly.
Second, since Algeria severed diplomatic relations with Morocco and Tunisia removed any form of a functioning government, it is left to be seen if North Africa can regain stable ground moving forward. The first of the ladder could go in either direction as the Moroccan government remains largely in control of key policy and economic decisions, and it will have to be seen what its next steps are post-Algerian divide. Yet, the future looks bright if Morocco continues to spread its economic, political, and cultural influence in its region.
Although Morocco has faced tall challenges amidst the pandemic, with GDP growth plummeting by 6.3% in 2020, its leadership remains confident in their ability to start an upward trend.
With the World Bank projecting that Morocco’s real GDP growth will rebound to 5.3% in 2021, the country has data and supporters backing up its faith. After being sustained by its extraordinary performance in agriculture through 2021, Morocco’s government can start to shift focus on its macro-financial vulnerabilities and ensure its transmission of monetary policy remains effective into the next year.
The same can not be said of Algeria – which has seen some increasing economic recovery thanks to China, but not enough to see its economic challenges be totally cleared.
But, some may respond, how can Morocco transition to aiding the global development of Sub-Saharan and Northern Africa if it must worry about its own domestic economic situation during COVID?
For starters, Morocco’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the period of FY19-FY24 is one of the Moroccan government and the World Banks’s overarching goals for the North African kingdom. This plan includes the ability for Morocco to: (a) contribute to social cohesion; (b) create economic growth and new jobs; and (c) reduce social and territorial disparities by promoting inclusive and resilient territorial development. 
All three of these goals are valuable in building up Morocco’s domestic economy while providing opportunities for easily moving jobs and development around the world. 
According to Hicham Ait Mansour, a professor at the Mohammed-V University in Rabat, the Moroccan government has already proved they can provide COVID-19 support through diverse avenues.
Over the past austere three-month lockdown in the early weeks of the COVID crisis, some of these avenues have been the Special Fund (rehabilitation of Health System), the extension of support to households who could not afford to take care of themselves, and more. Compared to similarly sized countries, Morocco is making great strides in vaccination rates and poverty reduction.
There are even future prospects for structural reform: with two phases dedicated to the extension and generalization of health and medical insurance and family/children allowances, and the implementation of unemployment allowances and pension scheme extension, Mansour states.
The 2014-2020 Acceleration Plan has also been a model that has allowed some of Morocco’s main industries to experience a rise in profit.
As the pandemic continues to slow, it seems that Morocco can multitask its duties to expand its international foothold while improving its domestic development as it has done in the past year and a half. 
Morocco in Sub-Saharan and Northern Africa
Feuds with neighbors and unemployment at home have driven Morocco to look beyond its borders to develop new markets and opportunities for its citizens, especially in these past few years. 
Looking at Morocco’s history, the closure of the Algeria-Morocco border in the 1990s and faltering relations with Libya might have been a blessing in disguise for Morocco to venture ahead into new economic prospects. Although its trade links to Europe are decades old, the capacity for Moroccan business to compete was limited. 
But with West African economies growing fast, Moroccan companies were able to get in the front of the pack for big opportunities. Investment in export-oriented manufacturing industries specifically has gradually allowed Morocco to diversify its economic output.
Today, Morocco continues to modernize its banking system, which is one of Africa’s largest and most valuable for the future development of the continent and Morocco’s own ambitious pan-African footprint. While banking has remained the steam engine to Morocco’s African venture, other business sectors have made a footing. 
Morocco is present in more than 14 sub-Saharan countries to date (mainly in the West African region), making it a key driver of regional growth, with the Moroccan Ministry of Finance recording a +9.5% trade increase on average per year over the past two decades.
On the home front, meanwhile, Morocco is a country that offers unlimited opportunities for investment. As one of the most stable countries in North Africa, the kingdom ranks among the top three recipients of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) in Africa.
Morocco’s next steps for policy implementation
1) Morocco must continue to consolidate Casablanca’s status as a financial hub not just for Morocco, but for all of Africa in more diverse sectors.
Since the government created Casablanca Finance City (CFC) in 2010 as a bridge between the economies of the Global North and South, 19 banks have been established and are operating in Morocco’s banking sector with $133bn in assets (2017).
However, as other regions of the world - especially Asia and Europe - regain footing and challenge MENA’s capabilities to stand on its own, Morocco must stand strong and sharpen its regional clout by investing in other sectors, including telecommunications, infrastructure, etc.
The success of Moroccan companies in Africa has hinged on the ability of King Mohammed VI to cultivate strategic links and personal relationships. Now it is time to further showcase to the global investors how dynamic and open Morocco is to a wide range of avenues in terms of revenue-generating and bridge-building activities.
2) Get more involved in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)
January 1st, 2021 marked Morocco’s first step at becoming part of the largest and progressive free trade agreements: AfCFTA. While it is still to be seen how AfCFTA will “fundamentally change the economic fortunes” of Africa, as South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has argued, the continent evidently has the potential to grow more economically than ever before.
If Morocco’s population is to keep up with Africa’s evenly-matched ambitious and well-educated population, the kingdom must continue its push to become a large player on the global stage. Morocco must get involved in more trade agreements, other policy agendas, and build new sustainable opportunities at home.

3) Focus on most competitive sectors and continue to invest in human capital
Morocco’s Most Competitive Sectors (2019). Graph by: World Bank Morocco Report, pg. 96
Morocco has steered significant resources toward large investments in economic sectors identified as strategic to growth (i.e., aerospace, electronics, etc.), but it should also increase productivity and find value in its largest export sectors.
Additionally, Morocco has numerous NGOs and religious centers providing aid to those growing up in tough conditions to place them in jobs and educate them. These types of investments into public health and human capital are what will set Morocco apart from many countries who are ignoring the pleas and cries of their citizens.
Considered as one of the most successful countries in both the South-Mediterranean and MENA regions, Morocco’s financial sector can only continue to witness progress and growth in its access to bank funding, investment, trade, regulation, and modernisation abroad and at home. 
Ultimately, the question should not be when will Morocco outpace its European rivals but rather when will Morocco outpace its MENA rivals? 
At the domestic level, change can occur by improving and implementing the conditions that have been set on a determined path (just waiting to follow through). Mitigating risks and opening up for more competition while improving and safeguarding Morocco’s current financial system’s capacity to respond to crises and slow moments should be at the core of continued growth for the Moroccan economy.

224,Stand Your Ground Laws: A Legal Excuse for Racist Killings in the US,"While intended as a legal justification for self-defense, Stand-your-ground has often been used to justify killings of unarmed minorities in the US.",Shaquile Goff,"Oct. 16, 2021 6:32 p.m.","Denver- The recent killing of 31-year old Moroccan Adil Dghoughi in Martindale, Texas has raised questions about whether the attacker, 65-year old Terry Turner, will be the latest murderer to escape justice via a controversial law present in several US states.
While the case is still in the early process of investigation, if Turner is charged by officers for the shooting it is likely legal defense will choose to justify the shooting through ""stand-your-ground"" legislation. Defense lawyers will likely attempt to paint Adil Dghoughi as a threat to Turner, as they have done in a similar fashion to other innocent minorities gunned down in brutal acts of violence.  
Origin of Stand-Your-Ground
Self-defense laws have traditionally been included in legislation to legally justify responding to attacks, however this has traditionally come with the obligation that a defender has a “duty to retreat” if reasonably able to do so. This changed in 2005, when Florida became the first US state to introduce a stand-your-ground law into their legislation. 
Stand-your-ground laws removed the duty to retreat against a perceived attacker. Instead, individuals were now justified in the use of deadly force during incidents where a person believes they are in imminent danger of deadly force or harm to their body or property without an obligation to leave or call the police.
As of 2021, over 30 states in the US now have stand-your-ground laws written into legislation justifying the use of deadly force during a perceived attack. 
Proponents of the law hailed stand-your-ground as an effective deterrent against criminal behavior, but several studies that have emerged since the law’s widespread implementation have found stand-your-ground laws have had the opposite effect in the US. 
In 2018, Non-profit policy think tank RAND institute released a report compiling several incidences when stand-your-ground was used as justification in a shooting death. RAND analysts found evidence that “these laws are associated with an increase in homicides” in states where stand-your-ground was authorized. RAND’s findings were later corroborated by at least four other studies with similar findings.  
RAND highlighted the higher homicide rate stemmed from the lower standard of justifying legal force that stand-your-ground allows. Analysts determined the laws “encourage impulsive and illegitimate uses of deadly force” in situations that could have otherwise been prevented.  
A Color-Coded Disparity
While it is clear that stand-your-ground produced higher homicide rates in states, studies also indicated that a huge racial disparity exists in the practical application of the law. A study from Texas A&M University revealed that “the shooting of a black person by a white person is found justifiable 17 percent of the time, while the shooting of a white person by a black person is deemed justifiable just over 1 percent of the time.”
The results of the study show a clear bias in how the legal system perceives the law when it’s employed to justify the killing of a minority in the US. University of Florida in Gainesville law professor and civil rights expert Darren Hutchinson added it’s “easier for whites to raise a stand-your-ground defense,” especially when the person killed is a minority.
Another study from the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center found cases where blacks and Latinos were killed to be 354% more likely to be justified by stand-your-ground laws than white-on-white killings. The clear racial disparity has allowed the extrajudicial killing of several unarmed minorities throughout the US for nearly two decades. 
Hope for Justice 
While it’s clear that many minorities in the US have been unjustly murdered under the guise of self-defense, there is still hope that victims like Adil Dghoughi can find justice in the US. In 2018, a Texas man was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting of three unarmed neighbors in Houston. Jurors in Houston convicted Raul Rodriguez of murder after he reportedly shot and killed an unarmed woman and injured two others in an argument. 
Rodriguez’s claims of self-defense were denied by the jury, who state no harm would have come to Rodriguez or the victims if he had not initially drawn his weapon. Although a rarity in a pro-gun state such as Texas, the case set a precedent of the limits of stand-your-ground justification. 
With the tragic death of Adil Dghoughi that occurred Monday, relatives are hoping for a similar display of justice from the Texas legal system. Adil’s actions in no way indicated a threat to Terry Turner, yet his life was taken by the Martindale resident anyway.
Considering reports that Adil was sitting in his car near Terry Turner’s residence with his windows rolled up and car in reverse, it is clear Adil had no intentions of entering or remaining on Turner’s property. Adil’s girlfriend claims he was likely stopped on Tina’s Trail in an attempt to find a signal for his GPS system, a difficult task in rural Texas.
With no indication that Turner attempted to ascertain what Adil was doing on his driveway, he promptly walked up and fired a shot into Adil’s car, killing him less than thirty minutes after he left his girlfriend’s residence. As the investigation into Turner’s shooting of Adil Dghoughi continues, the situation will serve as another test of the Texas justice system, and whether stand-your-ground will continue to be used as a superficial excuse to justify the impulsive killing of innocent people in so-called “self-defense”.

225,"For Many, COVID-19 Is Also A Mental Health Problem","As important as discussions about the virus’ physiological effects are, it’s important to acknowledge the mental health risks it can pose.",Oussama Aamari,"Oct. 16, 2021 4:17 p.m.","Rabat - The world is going through a crucial period in its fight against COVID-19, with vaccination rates on the rise and drugs being developed and studied. And while the physiological and socio-economic effects of the virus are an important and worthy topic of debate, many discussions can neglect another important aspect: mental health.
A recent study in the Journal of Psychology and Behavior Studies reveals how the pandemic has mentally affected university students, a particularly vulnerable group of people in Morocco.
COVID anxiety worldwide
Worldwide, the spread of COVID-19 and the necessity of preventative measures such as lockdowns and limiting activity, as well as the economic consequences of such measures on individuals, has led to a noticeable increase in cases of mental health disorders around the globe.
A poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) revealed that the average number of adults reporting symptoms of anxiety or depression went from 11% in 2019 to more than 40% in 2021, with more than 30% reporting difficulties in sleeping and eating.
The most obvious explanation for this dramatic hike is it being a direct result of the health effects that people have experienced throughout this period, from people who lost loved ones to the virus, to those that have contracted it themselves.
The preventative measures such as lockdowns can definitely be blamed to some extent, as social and professional lives have been greatly harmed in the process as a result of COVID restrictions.
For many in the KFF’s poll, there were even more consequences for the participants that were more tangible, such as closure of universities and the loss of income that many in vulnerable industries have experienced.
From parents worried about their children’s academic results, essential workers having to expose themselves to risks in a heated climate, to marginalized communities that have experienced the brunt of the virus’s consequences more than others, the point is that the pandemic has left its effects on the lives of people from all backgrounds.
The case of Morocco
A recent study in the Journal of Psychology and Behavior Studies by a group of Moroccan academics specifically explored the mental health effects of the coronavirus on Moroccan university students.
The study surveyed 560 students from five universities on various indicators of declining mental health, such as sleep quality and self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety.
The study reveals that 20% to 30% of students reported moderate to severe symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, correlating heavily with the number of participants who reported annoyance at the pandemic and the measures surrounding it.
Like in other countries, the radical change to the way of life that was forced on these students can be said to have greatly contributed to these symptoms. As university students tend to be some of the most socially active members of any society, having to stay at home at all times was something that the students were not familiar with. According to the study, the pandemic and its accompanying measures brought these students “psychological unrest and annoyance.” The fear of infection and the disease itself is also a contributing factor, as corroborated by previous studies in different regions.
It is also worth paying attention to the indirect effects of this pandemic, as academic performance has been affected for a lot of students, particularly those in rural areas with more difficulty in accessing the tools required to participate in online education.
In most cases, measures to improve these mental health conditions, ranging from new policies to aid groups, have been lacking, with steps to control the spread of the virus being considered more important.
So, what can be done?
It can be hard to try and solve these issues, with the reasons for these problems being so varied and ranging from economic to social and beyond, and especially since mental health services are already underfunded and overlooked.
An obvious first step is to financially support workers and people who are most likely to suffer economic harm from the closure of businesses and industries.
With vaccination campaigns progressing and preventative measures being relaxed, many are hoping that businesses will reopen on a wider scale and that people will be able to go back to work, although many projections and expert opinions are not as optimistic.
For students in particular, the aforementioned study mentions that universities have a responsibility to provide monitoring and assistance services for their students to keep track of these traumatic events and their effects.
It can be also said that the rise in mental health issues is not so much a result of the pandemic, as much as it was the result of the pandemic exacerbating problems that were already prominent in society.
Because of this, the best conclusion might be that it is time to confront mental health issues in a consistent and permanent manner, rather than just trying to apply a band-aid on the effects of the COVID pandemic.
Providing better mental help services through public and private channels, not only during trying times such as this one, but as a consistent and important goal for the far future is the first step in this regard.
A bigger undertaking that will require equally big social change is to remove the social stigma that surrounds openly discussing mental health problems. Morocco’s Ministry of Health for example recently launched a campaign to fight said stigma, which stands in the way of many people seeking the help they need.
Mental health issues are hard to talk about, and they’re even harder to solve. However, if there’s going to be any silver linings to the troubles that this pandemic has brought about, one of them should be a more open discussion of these issues, rather than attempting to sweep them under the rug.

226,Western Anti-China Hysteria Reaches Morocco-Algeria Dispute,A Newsweek opinion piece attempts to drag Morocco into the vast campaign of fear- mongering against China.,Jasper Hamann,"Oct. 16, 2021 1:10 p.m.","Rabat - A new opinion piece in US publication Newsweek appears to try to undermine Morocco’s warm relationship with China. Amid a vast global campaign to smear China as an aggressive threat, Morocco is being dragged into the early stages of the Second Cold War.
An opinion piece in Newsweek by Gordon Chang presents Algeria as China’s Maghreb pawn  attempting to harm US ally Morocco. While it is true that Morocco is a close ally to the US, the piece appears to completely ignore strong Morocco-China in an apparent effort to drag Morocco into the anti-China alliance.
Western powers appear to currently be engaged in a massive campaign to stoke fear about China and divide the world into pro- and anti-China camps. The campaign so far has been a massive success in the West as anti-Asian racism is reaching troubling heights and national leaders call on new military spending to counter the new “emerging threat.” 
China: The West’s new boogeyman
After two decades of war in the Middle East, Western powers are pivoting to China in search of a new boogeyman to justify military spending. Ironically, the countries that assured us of “weapons of mass destruction” in Iraq and the imminent need to bomb Libya into regime change, now point at China as an aggressive country that needs to be stopped.
Failed regime change in Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan appears to have done little to affect the confidence of Western powers to act as the world’s moral compass. 
That mistaken confidence was on full display in Newsweek’s opinion piece, which describes Algeria as China’s “client state” in a Chinese effort to “threaten Morocco.”
The piece had to use quotes from Mao Zedong (who died in 1976) about Algeria to attempt to drive a wedge between Morocco and China. 
A more recent look into Moroccan-Chinese relations shows a very different picture. An Arab Barometer study in July found that China is significantly more popular than the US across the Arab world, with 52% of Moroccans viewing China favorably, compared to 28% feeling the same about the US.
That sentiment has likely strengthened even further as thousands of Moroccan lives were saved through the millions of Chinese vaccines that made Morocco a continental leader in the fight against COVID-19, while much of the rest of Africa (including Algeria) continues to face vast vaccine shortages.
Undermining China-Morocco relations
If Algeria is indeed a “pawn” of China, and China is aiming to threaten Morocco, it is doing so in a weirdly ineffective way. Morocco is China’s first African partner in its Belt and Road initiative, has broken vaccination records in Africa thanks to bilateral vaccine deals with China, and Morocco’s government uses China’s Huawei for its digital technology.
With typical cold war hysteria, the Newsweek opinion piece claims that China is “arming Algeria to the teeth,” despite Russia supplying 75% of Algerian military equipment.  The same piece describes Morocco as a “holdout” as “Beijing seeks control of Africa.” 
As well as neglecting to mention centuries of Western attempts to control Africa, this conveniently ignores both the $4.47 billion in Chinese exports consumed in Morocco and the half a billion dollars worth of Moroccan products that China imports. 
Some of Moroccans’ most beloved products are Chinese, ranging from traditional products such as Chinese gunpowder tea which is a crucial part of Morocco’s famous mint-tea, to millions of Chinese smartphones used in Morocco. In fact, Morocco-China trade has grown on average by more than 15% every year of the past 24 years.
Newsweek’s opinion piece appears to be supportive of Morocco, warning it of an imminent “threat,” yet the poorly informed argument reveals itself to be a blatant propaganda piece aimed at undermining Morocco’s positive relations with China.

227,OCP Foundation: a Key Component in the Fight Against COVID-19 Crisis,"During a time of great uncertainty, the OCP Foundation’ original solutions contributed to reducing the negative effects of the pandemic through innovative operations and support systems.",Nisrine Jaouadi,"Oct. 15, 2021 2:59 p.m.","Rabat- Following a year of economic and social instability caused by the COVID-19 crisis, the OCP Foundation implemented a variety of innovative projects and activities aimed at addressing unprecedented global challenges. 
The OCP Group is a Moroccan state-owned phosphate mining company, phosphoric acid manufacturer and phosphate fertilizer producer, founded in 1920.
The company has expanded significantly over the years, becoming one of the world’s largest producers of phosphate and phosphate-based products, extending its activities into many other African and Asian countries.
As part of the OCP group's commitment to social and societal issues, the OCP Foundation aims to create equal opportunities for local communities through strategic initiatives that promote education, research, and innovation.
In order to face the effects of the unexpected health crisis, the OCP Foundation had a significant role in reducing the immediate impact of the pandemic in Morocco’s health, education, and agriculture sectors.
New Virology Center
With the support of the OCP Group and its Foundation, the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) and the Pasteur Institute of Morocco (IPM) signed an agreement in April 2020, to contribute to the development of the national virology research field by sharing resources and expertise.
As part of the agreement, the IPM will establish a medical virology center for highly pathogenic microorganisms within three years, for the detection, alert, monitoring and development of new diagnostic techniques. The agreement also includes the creation of a P3 category laboratory able to house research in virology within the UM6P.
The medical virology centers and P3 laboratory will aim to support the emergence of an entrepreneurial ecosystem for cutting-edge research, with a view of strengthening the national biomedical industry.
A call for projects in Research and Development (R&D) was also launched in order to promote the advancement of R&D in virology by uniting the expertise of both the UM6P and the IPM, and to create a special platform for scientists to conduct their research.
“The OCP Foundation has conducted this collaboration with professionalism, efficiency, and effective communication. Our teams are joining forces in order to achieve the best research that will allow us to protect citizens’ health through innovation, professionalism and solidarity,” Professor Abderrahmane Maaroufi, director of the IPM, said.
SILCOVID
The OCP Foundation and UM6P also launched the Social Innovation Lab (SIL), a laboratory that aims to create a strong social impact, by designing initiatives that meet the needs of various communities.
The SIL program is set to include training and skill development, as well as the collection, use and production of data, action research, and integrated social projects.
“SIL’s relevance is directly tied to its role in capitalization around various social actions carried out by the OCP Foundation and UM6P, to disseminate the knowledge acquired and promote new integrated models for social development,” according to Hassan Radoine, director and professor at the School of Architecture, Planning and Design at UM6P.
Remote learning
With remote learning being established as the main learning method following the announcement of the quarantine in March 2020, the OCP Foundation set up several actions in order to ensure pedagogical continuity.
Due to the effectual digitalization via the UM6P, the OCP foundation was able to provide assistance necessary within the educational ecosystem and to promote innovative approaches, which include:
The creation of the National Digitalization and Remote Learning Center, at UM6P, which aims to promote innovation and excellence, particularly in the field of higher education and scientific research. It is funded by the OCP foundation, and it focuses on innovation, digitalization, and educational approaches.
The creation of a teaching guide for distance learning during the quarantine, in collaboration with the Institute of Education Sciences at UM6P, for teachers, students, and parents to provide them with advice and learning techniques to take into consideration while partaking in online courses.
The launch of the “PrepaDigitale” platform, which contains more than 1,500 courses and allows more than 9760 students, teachers and inspectors of public preparatory classes to effectively supervise their preparations for engineering school contests.
The forming of support systems for Sub-Saharan African partners: In the midst of a terrifying viral outburst, the OCP Foundation made sure to provide support systems for Sub-Saharan partners such as Togo, Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Madagascar.
In collaboration with UM6P, the foundation was able to produce several guides and tutorials for the manufacture of soaps, antiseptic gels, face masks, and face shields. It also financed the purchase of raw materials for the production of various means of protection against the virus.
The creation of digital platforms to better support the Foundation’s stakeholders, such as CoopLab, a digital E-commerce for Moroccan and African cooperatives, Restore Africa Soils, an exchange platform dedicated to scientific discussions, and Olaya, a virtual aid to Moroccan communities in precarious situations due to COVID-19.

228,New Moroccan Government Faces High Expectations and Big Challenges,"As Moroccans continue to remain optimistic about the new government, Akhannouch’s government will have to find several solutions to the challenges that Morocco faces.",Amal El Attaq,"Oct. 14, 2021 7:57 p.m.","Rabat- Following the latest elections, Moroccans expect the new government to bring long-promised changes in terms of improving social protection programs, education, health, employment, and bolstering the national dialogue.
After an intense political campaign, 50.18% of voters turned out nationwide, with nearly 70 % of voters in Morocco’s southern provinces, making participation in 2021 elections far higher than that of 2016.  
Moroccans expressed their displeasure with the Justice and Development Party’ (PJD) performance by voting instead for the National Rally of Independents (RNI), raising expectations around the new government.
Hopes and dreams
""When the Moroccan people go to vote in the election, they hope for real change. Later, we find that no big change happened,"" Wissal, a 23-year-old student from Casablanca, told Morocco World News (MWN).
She added that although she stopped believing in elections, she made an exception this year and voted for the RNI, hoping for big changes to happen in Morocco. 
“My hopes and dreams are first and foremost that the new government will reform the education system and adapt it to the job market… as well as the creation of employment opportunities for recently graduated students especially,” she explained.
Wissal expressed her fears about not getting the job she has always dreamed of because of high unemployment in Morocco. “These feelings overwhelm and paralyze my mind, but I’m still trying to be optimistic.”
According to a new study from the High Commission for Planning (HCP), Morocco’s unemployment rate has moved from 9.2% in 2019 to 11.9% in 2020. The study noted the total number of unemployed people climbed by 29% to 322,000 people.
While some are putting their hopes on the new government, others remain sceptical over the value of the elections. Hassan is 30, unemployed, and decided not to vote in the latest elections. He said emigration is “the only solution to fulfil his dreams and have a better life, even if that means putting his life at risk.”
Hassan related that the pandemic made his financial situation even worse, as the COVID-19 crisis led to the loss of thousands of job opportunities. “I used to work from time to time in different jobs. But now everything changed; I have been looking for a job for a long time, and couldn’t find any.”
Bigger challenges
If Moroccans have for years “endured the efforts of structural reforms of both economy and finance sectors, today they have the right to grow in ambition and have higher expectations,” Moroccan political analyst Adil Benhamza, told Morocco World News.
He explained that Morocco has achieved important development at the macroeconomic level, and the problem is currently related to the weakness of the reflection of this success regarding social and spatial justice.
According to Benhamza, Morocco's choice of a new development model is a natural result of previous development and economic choices failure “in distributing the fruits of development equitably”.
Speaking about challenges that Akhannouch’s government will face, he related that the government has not revealed, so far, the funding sources of all its major projects. 
“In order to make a judgment about what the current government intends to do, we must wait for the new finance bill to get a complete picture about the situation; any lack of funding would hinder the government's ambitions.”
 “We must not forget that Morocco, when dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, expressed the ambition to develop trade internationally as well as investing in our strategic location near the most important global markets, and that will need a lot of funding resources,” concluded the analyst.
The country’s economy suffered unfavorable conditions in 2020, resulting in a contraction of 6.3% as a loss of 432,000 jobs. 
On the other hand, new data from Morocco’s High Commission of Planning (HCP) showed that Morocco’s national economy grew by 15.2% in the second quarter of 2021, as opposed to a drop of 14.2% during the same period in 2020.
Thus, many economic experts think the government should focus on counter-cyclical fiscal policy, by lowering public debt, reforming the pension and health systems and making them more sustainable, as well as creating a more business-friendly environment.
The governmental program
Amid the election campaign, Aziz Akhannouch, head of the National Rally of Independents, announced the provision of one million jobs if he would win the prime ministership, which some see as being difficult to achieve, but not impossible.
The first concrete test of the new government's ability or readiness to deliver on the promises detailed in its action plan will be related to the new finance bill of the upcoming year. The bill will be discussed on Friday. According to government regulations, the ministers have until October 20 to agree on a fiscal bill for 2022. 
Regarding the guiding principles of the governmental program, the new Head of Government emphasized the ten commitments of his government during the 2021-2026 period, such as his party’s promise to reevaluate salaries and pensions.
Akhannouch described his cabinet’s priorities on Monday, during a plenary session held by both houses of the Moroccan parliament. The incoming government aims to focus on strengthening of state-provided social services, a mass employment strategy, good governance in public management, as well as the establishment of a strong cooperative relationship between the executive and legislative bodies.
According to Akhannouch, the governmental agenda provides realistic and ambitious responses to get out of the COVID-19 crisis and project into the future with determination and consistency. The new coalition government in Morocco includes the National Rally of Independents (RNI), the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), and the Istiqlal Party.
On Friday October 8, King Mohammed VI said that “the development model opens up vast prospects for the work of the government”, urging it to complete the implementation of the major projects underway.
In his speech marking the opening of the Moroccan parliament’s  first legislative year of the 11th legislature, the King added that “despite the positive environment, we should remain realistic and continue to work in a responsible manner.”
The development model, which encompasses economic, social, and environmental aspects, is a long-term inclusive and participatory framework that “sets out new standards and opens up vast horizons for everyone.”

“It is really what cancer doctors' dreams are made of to see such a response like this,” Andrea Cercek, one of the lead researchers of the dostarlimab experiment team, told CNN. “Our patients are feeling great after the treatment.”
The remarkable findings, covering just 12 patients, were published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK).
The study was led by Andrea Cercek, Section Head of Colorectal Cancer and Co-Director of MSK’s Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancer, and Luis Alberto Diaz, Head of the Division of Solid Tumor Oncology.
Their work included 12 cancer patients who completed their treatment with dostarlimab and have undergone follow-up for 6 to 25 months. 
To date, none of the patients have been diagnosed with tumors or received chemoradiotherapy, or undergone surgery. 
Explaining how immunotherapy works, Cercek told CNN, that dostarlimab “unlocks the body's natural immune system to fight cancer,” which compensates for the lack of genes that repair DNA among patients with mismatch repair-deficient.

The “never seen before” results provide hope for more than 18 million cases that were diagnosed with cancer by 2020, particularly for rectal cancer cases that go through “toxic” therapy, said Cercek. 
A 2021 study showed an expected surge in new colorectal cancer worldwide and particularly in the US and China, providing an urgent need for less toxic and damaging cancer treatments. China and the US are expected to record  910,000 and 210,000 new colorectal cancer cases in 2040. 
Cancer cases in Morocco are also forecasted to increase from 144 cases per 100,000 people in 2018 to 192 in 2030 and 226 in 2040, according to the Swedish Institute for Health Economics. 
Morocco also has the highest cancer mortality rate in the region compared to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. The high mortality rate raises concerns among the patients and their families as they constantly experience fear of cancer.

231,"Russia-Ukraine Conflict: Moroccan Man Pleads Guilty, Could Face Death Penalty","Russia’s army arrested Brahim Saadoun in April, accusing him of fighting on the Ukrainian side.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 09, 2022 11:44 a.m.","Rabat - A Moroccan arrested by Russian troops could face the death penalty for fighting on Ukraine’s side against Russia.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Moroccan -- Brahim Saadoun -- and two British citizens could be sentenced to death after pleading guilty.
Russia’s RIA news agency published a video showing the three defendants in a cage inside a courtroom.
The Russian news agency said that Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, one of the two British prisoners, pleaded guilty to “actions aimed at the violent seizure of power.”
The video also shows the second  British defendant, Aiden Aslin, pleading guilty to his involvement with some kind of weapons and explosives regiment on the Ukrainian side of the ongoing war.
The Russian agency said that the charges could lead to death penalty sentences for the three men.
The trial of the three men is taking place in Donetsk, an industrial city in Eastern Ukraine that claimed independence at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Brahim Saadoun was arrested in April, with several Russian outlets sharing a video of the Moroccan man being interrogated by Russian soldiers.
Following his arrest, RunNews 24, a Russian channel, reported that Sadun was “operating in the Ukrainian army under contract.”
Prior to joining Ukraine’s resistance forces before Russia invaded the country in late February, the young Moroccan man was studying at the Faculty of Aerodynamic and Space Technologies at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI).
RUNEWS24 quoted him as saying he was frightened when he was arrested by Russian troops. “The most terrible thing was to realize that he was a few meters away from an enemy  that he had previously seen through binoculars,” he said.
Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued any communique regarding the arrest of the Moroccan man.
Meanwhile, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has denounced the Donetsk court's decision, emphasizing that prisoners “should not be prosecuted for participation in hostilities.”

232,Report: Media Coverage of Violence against Women in MENA is ‘Weak’,Media coverage of violent crimes against women in the MENA region does not offer context and could go as far as to blame victims.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 09, 2022 11:22 a.m.","Rabat - A new study has established that media coverage of violence against women remains fairly inadequate and fails to inform the public of the broader issues related to women's rights.
The study, published by the European Council, suggested that this trend is particularly true in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where media coverage of violence against women is “out of context,” “weak,” and perpetuates negative stereotypes about women.
Titled “Violence against Women in the Media in the MENA Region,” the study presents data from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Lebanon.
Regarding Morocco, the study concluded that despite having all the legal frameworks relating to the preservation of women’s rights, media coverage in the country on violence against women remains suboptimal.
Reports on violence against women are rarely in news headlines and almost never benefit from debates and investigations that would serve to put them in context and present them as social phenomena, argued the study. 
It added that on the few occasions where violence against women is highlighted in a public debate, the discussion tends to revolve around the severity of the sentence and whether or not the court should execute the perpetrator.

The study goes as far as to claim that some journalists, politicians, and stakeholders taking part in these debates and covering violence against women tend to reproduce stereotypes and “objectify” women, even when the underlying aim behind the debate is to enhance women’s participation into the public life.
In addition, the study maintained that media coverage of gendered violence “stigmatizes” victims and often contains nuances blaming victims.
The “inadequate” reporting contributes to the distortion of the public’s perception of crimes against women by “minimizing their gravity,” the study noted.
Citing a list of techniques used in media coverage from the MENA region, the study found that journalists often use euphemisms in describing violent crimes against women, diminishing their impact by labeling them as “issues” or “incidents.  
Without specifying the exact country where such belittling of violent crimes against women is commonplace, the study said that hosts of social entertainment programs promote violence against women by inviting victims on the same set as the perpetrators and go as far as to ask women to waive their rights to filing complaints.
It also noted the lack of media covering follow-up in the case of feminicides - murder crimes committed against women for being women -, explaining that in the MENA region, including Morocco, feminicides are covered during a short period that never exceeds 48 hours.

233,Video of Students Kicking Quran in Turkey Stirs Outrage,The Turkish Ministry of Education said that they will take disciplinary action against the students involved in the incident.,Sara Zouiten,"June 08, 2022 5:13 p.m.","Rabat - A video featuring high school students kicking and desecrating a copy of the Quran in Turkey (Türkiye) sparked outrage among internet users. The incident took place in a high school in the Serik district, Antalya.
The clip shows a student throwing a copy of the Quran in the air, while another student kicked it. Students are heard laughing in the background as the religious text hits the ceiling before falling to the ground.
Turkey’s Ministry of Education announced yesterday that “disciplinary action has been taken against the students involved in the incident,” which they describe as an “unacceptable behavior towards the Qu’ran.”
The Ministry has also assigned an inspector to further investigate the incident.
The video sparked widespread shock and anger among Muslims in Turkey and Arab countries, with many demanding the students be held accountable for their actions.
The incident is not the first act of Quran desecration to occur in the country. In October last year, police arrested four people in northern Turkey after a video had circulated online showing individuals tearing and throwing pages from the Quran in a football stadium.

Several organizations and countries, as well as the Muslim community in Sweden, criticized and condemned the Danish party’s ongoing hateful actions against Islam.

According to reports, the gang members coerced minor girls into sending them explicit photos and videos before threatening to publish the content online. The gang had been blackmailing many victims into giving them large amounts of money.
On June 6, police arrested one of the gang members after the crime was reported by one of the female students, who had been a victim of blackmail for an entire year..
With the help of the minor girl, police set up a trap for the gang member, who thought he was meeting with the victim to receive another sum of extortion money. 
After the girl met with the man and handed him an envelope containing money, police surrounded the gang member and arrested him, leading to the arrest of the remainder of the network members.

The female student had been the victim of blackmail for an entire year, during which she was forced to steal large sums of money from her parents to pay her blackmailer.
Fed up with the neverending threats and blackmail, she decided to put an end to her suffering and tell her family about the matter.
Following the arrest of the remaining members of the crime enterprise, police discovered that the gang had other female victims who were exposed to the same form of blackmail. 
The crime starts with the criminals in question making young girls believe that they are communicating with someone their own age who is interested in a relationship with them. After the criminals acquire personal pictures and videos of the victims, the blackmail starts.
In 2019, Morocco recorded around 385 cases cybercrime cases, most of which were sexual blackmail and online scams, according to the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN).
Morocco was the first non-European country to sign the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the first international treaty that seeks to address internet and computer crimes and enhance cooperation and disclosure of electronic evidence.

235,More Countries Join Campaign Condemning India Over Anti-Islam Sentiments,India is reported to have seen notable upticks in anti-Islam sentiments and comments since the BJP’s Narendra Modi took the helm of the government in 2014.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 08, 2022 12:34 p.m.","Rabat - As more Muslim-majority countries continue to take issue with India over slanderous, anti-Islam comments by two senior members of the Asian country’s ruling party, Indonesia and Malaysia are the latest to join the chorus of condemnation targeting the Indian government.  
Both the Malaysian and Indonesian governments have summoned India’s ambassadors to comment on the “derogatory” statements of two officials from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) that has ruled India since 2014. 
Nupur Sharma, a spokeswoman of the Bharatiya BJP,  sparked a wave of anger and outrage among the Muslim communities across the world after she insulted the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aicha in public TV debate.
Another BJP spokesman, Naveen Kumal Jindal, also faced suspension from the party for making controversial, anti-Islam comments on social media.  Jindal’s offensive comments caused outrage not only among social media users but also among governments in Muslim countries.
The governments of Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Iran, Pakistan, and Oman summoned India’s envoys in their respective countries to condemn what they characterized as blasphemous and offensive comments that incite hatred and exacerbate social divisions.

Amid the widespread backlash, leaders of the Hindu nationalist BJP have since urged other officials to be “extremely cautious” when discussing religion on public platforms.
“We don’t want party officials to speak in a way that hurts the religious sentiments of any community,” a senior BJP speaker said.
India has been facing criticism for a noted increase in Islamophobia, with many reports indicating that the country has seen notable upticks in anti-Islam sentiments and comments since the BJP’s Narendra Modi took the helm of the government in 2014.
Over the past months, researchers and activists have documented -- and warned against -- a marked increase in Islamophobic acts and repression against Muslims.
Around 213 million Muslims live in India, representing 15.5% of the country’s population.
Earlier this year, Hindu groups called for further restrictions on Muslim women wearing Hijab at schools.
The group’s request came after a court ruled that hijab is not “an essential principle of Islam.”
Observers have warned that such developments may further exacerbate India’s already deep socio-religious fracture. 
But with the recent controversy surrounding the Sharma and Jindal cases having prompted the BJP to publicly distance itself from India’s rampant cycle of Islamophobia, it remains to be seen whether the country’s ruling party will actually commit to protecting the rights of Indian Muslims.

236,US Embassy in Morocco Celebrates LGBTQ+ Pride Month,Pride month pays homage to years of struggle in the ongoing pursuit of LGBTQ+ rights.,Sara Zouiten,"June 08, 2022 11:58 a.m.","Rabat - The United States Embassy in Morocco has taken to social media to celebrate pride month and express support for the LGBTQ+ community.
Every year, during the month of June, the LGBTQ+ community across the world celebrates pride month. The event intends to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ issues and fight for their rights.
The embassy posted a picture of bold colorful letters saying “Happy Pride Month,” with the caption: “Human rights are universal.”
“A person’s ability to exercise their human rights should never be limited based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression,” added the embassy, further explaining what pride month is and the purpose behind celebrating it.
Even though Morocco is a Muslim country where homosexuality is strictly forbidden, activists and organizations have made several attempts to normalize and decriminalize same-sex relations, as well as fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the country.

In January of this year, young Moroccan writer Fatima Zahra Amzkar launched her novel “Lesbian Diaries,” where she tackles the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community in Morocco through the eyes of the leading character “Tytyma.”
After receiving widespread backlash and criticism from Moroccans, the country’s Ministry of Culture announced that they have pulled the novel from Rabat’s International Book Fair 2022. The announcement came one day before the book fair started.
Pride month occurs during June to pay homage to the Stonewall riots, a series of riots by members of the LGBTQ+ community that took place at the end of June 1969 after police raided a gay club in New York City. 
The riots ultimately triggered the gay rights movement as we know it today. In 1970, the first Pride parade was organized with the participation of hundreds of people.
The pride month celebrations and events are open to participation by members of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as heterosexual people. 
LGBTQ is an acronym meaning Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer. The term is sometimes extended to LGBTQIA to include intersex and asexual people.

237,The Officialization of Amazigh Still Faces Many Obstacles,"Despite being enshrined in the constitution 11 years ago, activists say the integration is going at a sluggish pace.",Oussama Aamari,"June 07, 2022 1:38 p.m.","Rabat - A new report by the National Federation of Amazigh Associations (FNAA) has outlined the difficulties facing the Amazigh language’s integration as an official language in Morocco’s government and schools.
Despite being enshrined in the Moroccan constitution as an official language 11 years ago, the officialization of Tamazight has been much slower than necessary, FNAA said.
In the education field, the federation yet again decried the pace of the integration process, noting that only two years are left until the official deadline to start teaching the Amazigh language across all levels of public schooling.
Tamazight teachers continue to face systemic issues and discrimination, with didactic training for them being often put on hold, the federation said. This “points to an active threat to the contents and victories of the 2011 constitution,” noted FNAA’s report.
It also mentioned the Ministry of Education inflating the numbers of students enrolled in Amazigh language programs, and insisted that Moroccans residing abroad are not receiving adequate access to the education.
While acknowledging efforts toward the media integration and usage of the language, the FNAA said they remain inadequate. As a result, it argued, Tamazight continues to be treated more as a dialect than a standalone language.
The report also decries that productions in the Amazigh language continue to be underfunded and understaffed compared to those in Arabic.
The institutional implementation of the language has been similarly lagging, FNAA added, pointing out that most implementations have been purely superficial and not as wide.
For the federation, Tamazight must be used in an equal capacity to Arabic and French, and not relegated to being an afterthought that is only fit for translating official documents.
Morocco’s new government, elected in October of 2021, and led by Aziz Akhannouch, has vowed to make the integration of the language a priority, and to achieve the goals set by the 2011 constitution as soon as possible.
But FNAA’s report insisted the government should expedite the process of officializing the language. Such a push, it concluded, would help preserve a crucial part of the country’s history and cultural fabric, while also allowing Moroccans to put their Amazigh knowledge to use in professional and official capacities.

238,Morocco Calls for Vigilance Against Monkeypox,"The Minister of Health said that there is no cure for the disease, the virus of which disappears after three weeks of infection.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 07, 2022 12:29 p.m.","Rabat - While reassuring citizens that monkeypox disease does not spread as rapidly as COVID-19, Morocco’s Minister of Health Khalid Ait Taleb called for collective vigilance as the country puts in place the measures to fight against the virus.
In a series of answers for MPs at the House of Representatives, Ait Taleb warned on Monday that monkeypox requires more vigilance to avoid infection. While the Monkeypox virus disappears three weeks after infection, there is to date no cure for the disease, he emphasized.
Ait Taleb also outlined Morocco’s strategy to fight against the spread of the virus, recalling that the country has adopted a four-phase plan to tackle the Monkeypox crisis.
The first phase of Morocco’s plan focuses on training health professionals to diagnose and treat the disease, while the second phase covers the process of diagnosing the disease in laboratories.
The third phase concerns the management of suspected cases, whereas the fourth phase focuses on the separation of infected persons from their contacts.
“If a  person's infection is confirmed, the optimal method at the treatment phase is home isolation for a period of three weeks,” the minister explained, emphasizing that admission to a hospital only happens in critical cases when the patient is affected in the lungs, brain or eye.
On June 2, Morocco’s Ministry of Health confirmed the first case of monkeypox, noting that the infection was imported from a European country.
While the patient's state of health is stable and does not cause concern, he is under medical supervision in accordance with the health measures adopted to fight against this virus, the ministry stressed.
Monkeypox symptoms include fever, intense headache, back pain, swollen lymph nodes, as well as skin rash.
The symptoms last between two days to a month.
Over the past few days, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that more countries are set to see an outbreak of monkeypox.

239,Moroccan Transport Professionals Decry Inadequate Subsidies,The government announced the launch of a third stage of subsidies for transport professionals today.,Oussama Aamari,"June 07, 2022 11:44 a.m.","Rabat - Workers in the transport sector in Morocco have criticized the government for failing to give them their share of the subsidies that were announced to protect workers amid rising prices.
The Ministry of Transport and Logistics announced that a third wave of subsidies would open for applications on June 8, but union activists said that many workers did not receive the monetary support from the first and second phases of the government’s support scheme for transport professionals.
Despite signing up for the support program, 40% of workers did not receive their share of subsidies, union activists said, adding that they are working on referring all the relevant information to the authorities.
Workers also complained that the subsidies do not adequately cover the rise in fuel prices that the world has experienced lately, but that they also cannot raise prices to reflect that because of government support.
Some have also suggested subsidizing fuel prices instead and capping them for transport professionals, arguing this is a more reliable measure for protecting all the involved parties.
The support program was launched in April, with Morocco spending over MAD 300 million ($30 million) on a special program to support transport professionals.
The program was spurred on by a rising trend for fuel prices worldwide, as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine.
Fuel expenses can represent up to 70% of the expenditures taken on by drivers, meaning a price increase in diesel and gasoline can substantially affect the prices consumers end up paying.
Morocco’s government has also been supporting other products and commodities that saw a rise in prices, such as grains and gas.
Recently, textbook publishers have also expressed a desire to raise prices due to rising production costs, but the government expressed intentions to preserve the prices as a “national priority.”

240,Stabilizing Textbook Prices ‘A National Priority’ for Morocco,Publishers reportedly want to increase prices by 25% during the 2022-23 academic year.,Oussama Aamari,"June 06, 2022 9:46 p.m.","Rabat - Preserving the stability of school textbooks prices remains “a national priority,” Minister of Education Chakib Benmoussa said on Monday, in response to publishers’ desire to revise prices for the next school year.
In a forum organized by the Moroccan News Agency (MAP) under the theme “What roadmap makes for quality in public education?” the minister insisted on the importance of reducing profit margins and production costs.
The government is currently examining textbook publishers’ request to revise prices, he added, taking into account the increase in paper prices and other production costs on the global scale.
Adding that 70% of primary level textbooks are funded by the state as part of the Million Backpacks initiative, Benmoussa stressed that guaranteeing the books’ availability and finding answers for the potential price increase is a priority for the government.
Government Spokesperson Mustapha Baitas had previously stated that the government remains undecided on the price increase, acknowledging that they did receive requests from publishers.
The publishers reportedly want to increase prices by 25% for the 2022-2023 academic year, which could place a burden on parents –especially in disadvantaged families– amid steady price rises for other essential products and commodities.
There were similar increases in book and tuition prices in 2018, which parents heavily protested. School supplies cost families as much as MAD 4,000 ($400) that year, a steep price for the average Moroccan family.
Food products such as grain and oil and fuel like diesel and gasoline have seen a steady increase over the past few months, as global markets remain in crisis mode.
Supply chain disruptions caused by theCOVID-19 crisis, the conflict in Ukraine, and climate change have all contributed to rising prices across the board. Amid the ensuing confusion and panic over skyrocketing market prices,  Moroccan citizens and politicians -- especially opposition MPs -- alike say that the government’s duty is to do everything it can to protect citizens’ purchasing power.

241,India Faces Backlash Over Officials’ Derogatory Comments About Islam,Critics and watchers of India maintain that Islamophobia has been on the rise in the country since the Hindu nationalist party BJP took the helm in 2014.,Aya Benazizi,"June 06, 2022 5:05 p.m.","Rabat - India is facing a major diplomatic backlash from Muslim-majority countries after top officials from the country’s ruling Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made derogatory remarks about Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.
The senior officials’ blasphemous comments drew the ire of many Arab countries, leaving New Delhi scrambling to limit the harmful impact of the country’s latest anti-Islam scandal.
In response to the offensive, Islamophobic comments by senior BJP officials Nupur Sharma and Naveen Kumar Jindal, a number of Arab countries have submitted official objections against India. 
The outpouring of outrage began last week when the two BJP members made remarks that were seen as insulting to Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha.
During a televised debate on the vexed Gyanvapi mosque controversy, Sharma made derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha’s age. 
Her remarks sparked controversy, prompting multiple protests from Muslim groups in India, with reports later indicating that around 40 individuals, including police officers, were hurt during the protests in the city of Kanpur. 
Several First Information Reports (FIR) were filed against Sharma for infringing on religious emotions during her now-notorious television debate. The first FIR was registered by the Mumbai Police at the behest of the Islamist group Raza Academy, while the second was filed on June 1 by the Mumbra police in Thane based on a complaint by Mohammad Gufran Khan, a school teacher.

After being expelled from BJP, Sharma issued an apology on Sunday, stressing that her intention was not to hurt anyone. “If my words have caused discomfort or hurt religious feelings of anyone whatsoever, I hereby unconditionally withdraw my statement,” she said in a tweet.
Jindal, for his part, made provocative statements about Prophet Muhammad on Twitter on June 1. In response, social media users launched a campaign on Twitter under the hashtag “Arrest Naveen Jindal.” Faced with a torrent of backlash, the BJP official later deleted his tweet.
After he was suspended from the BJP, Jindal posted another tweet yesterday urging everyone to not make his address public as he was getting death threats on social media. “I have a special request to all, please do not make my address public, threats to kill me and my family are being given continuously on social media too,” he said.
Amid the social media melee, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran have all requested an apology from India’s government for tolerating insulting, anti-Islam statements from senior officials of the country’s ruling political party.
The BJP did not take any action against Jindal and Sharma until Sunday, after the governments of Qatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Iran summoned Indian ambassadors in their respective countries for clarification. 
In a bid to assuage the backlash it has been experiencing on the diplomatic front, India’s ruling, Hindu nationalist party banned Sharma and expelled Jindal. The party notably issued an unusual statement in which it “strongly denounces disrespect to any religious personalities,” a decision that Qatar and Kuwait applauded.
In addition to the strong condemnation by governments of Muslim-majority countries, many on social media have launched campaigns calling to boycott Indian products as a way of expressing their anger toward the Indian government for accommodating anti-Islam sentiments.
According to Al Jazeera, Indian products were removed from shelves in certain Kuwaiti shops on Monday.
Aggressive reactions to aggressive statements
Because offending Prophet Muhammad is a red line for Muslims, Muslim-majority countries were outraged by India’s offensive Islamophobic statements.
Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Soltan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi warned in a statement that “these insulting remarks would lead to incitement of religious hatred, and offend more than two billion Muslims around the world.”
Meanwhile, Kuwait cautioned that if the statements were not punished, India would experience “an increase of extremism and hatred.”
Doha, on the other hand, is expecting “a public apology and immediate condemnation of these remarks” from the Indian government.
Saudi Arabia and Iran also submitted complaints with India, while the Jeddha-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation stated the statements came in a “context of intensifying hatred and abuse toward Islam in India and systematic practices against Muslims.”
Pakistan, for its part, summoned an Indian envoy on Monday to express Islamabad’s “strong condemnation.” This came a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif claimed the BJP officials’ remarks were “hurtful” and that “India under [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi is trampling religious liberties and harassing Muslims.”
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said in a statement: “These insults come in the context of the increasing intensity in hatred of and insults to Islam in India and the systematic harassment of Muslims.” 
So far, New Delhi has made no comment on the Arab states’ objections, but the Indian Foreign Ministry on Monday dismissed the OIC’s views as “unwarranted” and “narrow-minded.”
The Indian embassies in Qatar and Doha issued a statement on Sunday, saying that harsh measures had already been taken against individuals who made the disparaging remarks against Islam. Both declarations notably insisted that the sentiments voiced against the Prophet Muhammad and Islam were not those of the Indian government and were expressed by “fringe elements.”

242,"Dostarlimab, First Treatment to ‘Completely Eliminate Cancer’",Dostarlimab provides hope for the end of cancer amid an expected global surge in new cases.,Souad Anouar,"June 09, 2022 12:00 p.m.","Rabat - A recent study found that dostarlimab, an immunotherapy for cancer, can “completely eliminate cancer” while preserving normal body function.
“It is really what cancer doctors' dreams are made of to see such a response like this,” Andrea Cercek, one of the lead researchers of the dostarlimab experiment team, told CNN. “Our patients are feeling great after the treatment.”
The remarkable findings, covering just 12 patients, were published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK).
The study was led by Andrea Cercek, Section Head of Colorectal Cancer and Co-Director of MSK’s Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancer, and Luis Alberto Diaz, Head of the Division of Solid Tumor Oncology.
Their work included 12 cancer patients who completed their treatment with dostarlimab and have undergone follow-up for 6 to 25 months. 
To date, none of the patients have been diagnosed with tumors or received chemoradiotherapy, or undergone surgery. 
Explaining how immunotherapy works, Cercek told CNN, that dostarlimab “unlocks the body's natural immune system to fight cancer,” which compensates for the lack of genes that repair DNA among patients with mismatch repair-deficient.

The “never seen before” results provide hope for more than 18 million cases that were diagnosed with cancer by 2020, particularly for rectal cancer cases that go through “toxic” therapy, said Cercek. 
A 2021 study showed an expected surge in new colorectal cancer worldwide and particularly in the US and China, providing an urgent need for less toxic and damaging cancer treatments. China and the US are expected to record  910,000 and 210,000 new colorectal cancer cases in 2040. 
Cancer cases in Morocco are also forecasted to increase from 144 cases per 100,000 people in 2018 to 192 in 2030 and 226 in 2040, according to the Swedish Institute for Health Economics. 
Morocco also has the highest cancer mortality rate in the region compared to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. The high mortality rate raises concerns among the patients and their families as they constantly experience fear of cancer.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Moroccan -- Brahim Saadoun -- and two British citizens could be sentenced to death after pleading guilty.
Russia’s RIA news agency published a video showing the three defendants in a cage inside a courtroom.
The Russian news agency said that Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, one of the two British prisoners, pleaded guilty to “actions aimed at the violent seizure of power.”
The video also shows the second  British defendant, Aiden Aslin, pleading guilty to his involvement with some kind of weapons and explosives regiment on the Ukrainian side of the ongoing war.
The Russian agency said that the charges could lead to death penalty sentences for the three men.
The trial of the three men is taking place in Donetsk, an industrial city in Eastern Ukraine that claimed independence at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Brahim Saadoun was arrested in April, with several Russian outlets sharing a video of the Moroccan man being interrogated by Russian soldiers.
Following his arrest, RunNews 24, a Russian channel, reported that Sadun was “operating in the Ukrainian army under contract.”
Prior to joining Ukraine’s resistance forces before Russia invaded the country in late February, the young Moroccan man was studying at the Faculty of Aerodynamic and Space Technologies at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI).
RUNEWS24 quoted him as saying he was frightened when he was arrested by Russian troops. “The most terrible thing was to realize that he was a few meters away from an enemy  that he had previously seen through binoculars,” he said.
Morocco’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued any communique regarding the arrest of the Moroccan man.
Meanwhile, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has denounced the Donetsk court's decision, emphasizing that prisoners “should not be prosecuted for participation in hostilities.”

244,Report: Media Coverage of Violence against Women in MENA is ‘Weak’,Media coverage of violent crimes against women in the MENA region does not offer context and could go as far as to blame victims.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 09, 2022 11:22 a.m.","Rabat - A new study has established that media coverage of violence against women remains fairly inadequate and fails to inform the public of the broader issues related to women's rights.
The study, published by the European Council, suggested that this trend is particularly true in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where media coverage of violence against women is “out of context,” “weak,” and perpetuates negative stereotypes about women.
Titled “Violence against Women in the Media in the MENA Region,” the study presents data from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Lebanon.
Regarding Morocco, the study concluded that despite having all the legal frameworks relating to the preservation of women’s rights, media coverage in the country on violence against women remains suboptimal.
Reports on violence against women are rarely in news headlines and almost never benefit from debates and investigations that would serve to put them in context and present them as social phenomena, argued the study. 
It added that on the few occasions where violence against women is highlighted in a public debate, the discussion tends to revolve around the severity of the sentence and whether or not the court should execute the perpetrator.

The study goes as far as to claim that some journalists, politicians, and stakeholders taking part in these debates and covering violence against women tend to reproduce stereotypes and “objectify” women, even when the underlying aim behind the debate is to enhance women’s participation into the public life.
In addition, the study maintained that media coverage of gendered violence “stigmatizes” victims and often contains nuances blaming victims.
The “inadequate” reporting contributes to the distortion of the public’s perception of crimes against women by “minimizing their gravity,” the study noted.
Citing a list of techniques used in media coverage from the MENA region, the study found that journalists often use euphemisms in describing violent crimes against women, diminishing their impact by labeling them as “issues” or “incidents.  
Without specifying the exact country where such belittling of violent crimes against women is commonplace, the study said that hosts of social entertainment programs promote violence against women by inviting victims on the same set as the perpetrators and go as far as to ask women to waive their rights to filing complaints.
It also noted the lack of media covering follow-up in the case of feminicides - murder crimes committed against women for being women -, explaining that in the MENA region, including Morocco, feminicides are covered during a short period that never exceeds 48 hours.

The incident took place in a high school in the Serik district, Antalya.
The clip shows a student throwing a copy of the Quran in the air, while another student kicked it. Students are heard laughing in the background as the religious text hits the ceiling before falling to the ground.
Turkey’s Ministry of Education announced yesterday that “disciplinary action has been taken against the students involved in the incident,” which they describe as an “unacceptable behavior towards the Qu’ran.”
The Ministry has also assigned an inspector to further investigate the incident.
The video sparked widespread shock and anger among Muslims in Turkey and Arab countries, with many demanding the students be held accountable for their actions.
The incident is not the first act of Quran desecration to occur in the country. In October last year, police arrested four people in northern Turkey after a video had circulated online showing individuals tearing and throwing pages from the Quran in a football stadium.

Both the Malaysian and Indonesian governments have summoned India’s ambassadors to comment on the “derogatory” statements of two officials from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) that has ruled India since 2014. 
Nupur Sharma, a spokeswoman of the Bharatiya BJP,  sparked a wave of anger and outrage among the Muslim communities across the world after she insulted the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aicha in public TV debate.
Another BJP spokesman, Naveen Kumal Jindal, also faced suspension from the party for making controversial, anti-Islam comments on social media.  Jindal’s offensive comments caused outrage not only among social media users but also among governments in Muslim countries.
The governments of Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Iran, Pakistan, and Oman summoned India’s envoys in their respective countries to condemn what they characterized as blasphemous and offensive comments that incite hatred and exacerbate social divisions.

Amid the widespread backlash, leaders of the Hindu nationalist BJP have since urged other officials to be “extremely cautious” when discussing religion on public platforms.
“We don’t want party officials to speak in a way that hurts the religious sentiments of any community,” a senior BJP speaker said.
India has been facing criticism for a noted increase in Islamophobia, with many reports indicating that the country has seen notable upticks in anti-Islam sentiments and comments since the BJP’s Narendra Modi took the helm of the government in 2014.
Over the past months, researchers and activists have documented -- and warned against -- a marked increase in Islamophobic acts and repression against Muslims.
Around 213 million Muslims live in India, representing 15.5% of the country’s population.
Earlier this year, Hindu groups called for further restrictions on Muslim women wearing Hijab at schools.
The group’s request came after a court ruled that hijab is not “an essential principle of Islam.”
Observers have warned that such developments may further exacerbate India’s already deep socio-religious fracture. 
But with the recent controversy surrounding the Sharma and Jindal cases having prompted the BJP to publicly distance itself from India’s rampant cycle of Islamophobia, it remains to be seen whether the country’s ruling party will actually commit to protecting the rights of Indian Muslims.

248,US Embassy in Morocco Celebrates LGBTQ+ Pride Month,Pride month pays homage to years of struggle in the ongoing pursuit of LGBTQ+ rights.,Sara Zouiten,"June 08, 2022 11:58 a.m.","Rabat - The United States Embassy in Morocco has taken to social media to celebrate pride month and express support for the LGBTQ+ community.
Every year, during the month of June, the LGBTQ+ community across the world celebrates pride month. The event intends to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ issues and fight for their rights.
The embassy posted a picture of bold colorful letters saying “Happy Pride Month,” with the caption: “Human rights are universal.”
“A person’s ability to exercise their human rights should never be limited based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression,” added the embassy, further explaining what pride month is and the purpose behind celebrating it.
Even though Morocco is a Muslim country where homosexuality is strictly forbidden, activists and organizations have made several attempts to normalize and decriminalize same-sex relations, as well as fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the country.

In January of this year, young Moroccan writer Fatima Zahra Amzkar launched her novel “Lesbian Diaries,” where she tackles the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community in Morocco through the eyes of the leading character “Tytyma.”
After receiving widespread backlash and criticism from Moroccans, the country’s Ministry of Culture announced that they have pulled the novel from Rabat’s International Book Fair 2022. The announcement came one day before the book fair started.
Pride month occurs during June to pay homage to the Stonewall riots, a series of riots by members of the LGBTQ+ community that took place at the end of June 1969 after police raided a gay club in New York City. 
The riots ultimately triggered the gay rights movement as we know it today. In 1970, the first Pride parade was organized with the participation of hundreds of people.
The pride month celebrations and events are open to participation by members of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as heterosexual people. 
LGBTQ is an acronym meaning Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer. The term is sometimes extended to LGBTQIA to include intersex and asexual people.

249,The Officialization of Amazigh Still Faces Many Obstacles,"Despite being enshrined in the constitution 11 years ago, activists say the integration is going at a sluggish pace.",Oussama Aamari,"June 07, 2022 1:38 p.m.","Rabat - A new report by the National Federation of Amazigh Associations (FNAA) has outlined the difficulties facing the Amazigh language’s integration as an official language in Morocco’s government and schools.
Despite being enshrined in the Moroccan constitution as an official language 11 years ago, the officialization of Tamazight has been much slower than necessary, FNAA said.
In the education field, the federation yet again decried the pace of the integration process, noting that only two years are left until the official deadline to start teaching the Amazigh language across all levels of public schooling.
Tamazight teachers continue to face systemic issues and discrimination, with didactic training for them being often put on hold, the federation said. This “points to an active threat to the contents and victories of the 2011 constitution,” noted FNAA’s report.
It also mentioned the Ministry of Education inflating the numbers of students enrolled in Amazigh language programs, and insisted that Moroccans residing abroad are not receiving adequate access to the education.
While acknowledging efforts toward the media integration and usage of the language, the FNAA said they remain inadequate. As a result, it argued, Tamazight continues to be treated more as a dialect than a standalone language.
The report also decries that productions in the Amazigh language continue to be underfunded and understaffed compared to those in Arabic.
The institutional implementation of the language has been similarly lagging, FNAA added, pointing out that most implementations have been purely superficial and not as wide.
For the federation, Tamazight must be used in an equal capacity to Arabic and French, and not relegated to being an afterthought that is only fit for translating official documents.
Morocco’s new government, elected in October of 2021, and led by Aziz Akhannouch, has vowed to make the integration of the language a priority, and to achieve the goals set by the 2011 constitution as soon as possible.
But FNAA’s report insisted the government should expedite the process of officializing the language. Such a push, it concluded, would help preserve a crucial part of the country’s history and cultural fabric, while also allowing Moroccans to put their Amazigh knowledge to use in professional and official capacities.

250,Morocco Calls for Vigilance Against Monkeypox,"The Minister of Health said that there is no cure for the disease, the virus of which disappears after three weeks of infection.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 07, 2022 12:29 p.m.","Rabat - While reassuring citizens that monkeypox disease does not spread as rapidly as COVID-19, Morocco’s Minister of Health Khalid Ait Taleb called for collective vigilance as the country puts in place the measures to fight against the virus.
In a series of answers for MPs at the House of Representatives, Ait Taleb warned on Monday that monkeypox requires more vigilance to avoid infection. While the Monkeypox virus disappears three weeks after infection, there is to date no cure for the disease, he emphasized.
Ait Taleb also outlined Morocco’s strategy to fight against the spread of the virus, recalling that the country has adopted a four-phase plan to tackle the Monkeypox crisis.
The first phase of Morocco’s plan focuses on training health professionals to diagnose and treat the disease, while the second phase covers the process of diagnosing the disease in laboratories.
The third phase concerns the management of suspected cases, whereas the fourth phase focuses on the separation of infected persons from their contacts.
“If a  person's infection is confirmed, the optimal method at the treatment phase is home isolation for a period of three weeks,” the minister explained, emphasizing that admission to a hospital only happens in critical cases when the patient is affected in the lungs, brain or eye.
On June 2, Morocco’s Ministry of Health confirmed the first case of monkeypox, noting that the infection was imported from a European country.
While the patient's state of health is stable and does not cause concern, he is under medical supervision in accordance with the health measures adopted to fight against this virus, the ministry stressed.
Monkeypox symptoms include fever, intense headache, back pain, swollen lymph nodes, as well as skin rash.
The symptoms last between two days to a month.
Over the past few days, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that more countries are set to see an outbreak of monkeypox.

251,Moroccan Transport Professionals Decry Inadequate Subsidies,The government announced the launch of a third stage of subsidies for transport professionals today.,Oussama Aamari,"June 07, 2022 11:44 a.m.","Rabat - Workers in the transport sector in Morocco have criticized the government for failing to give them their share of the subsidies that were announced to protect workers amid rising prices.
The Ministry of Transport and Logistics announced that a third wave of subsidies would open for applications on June 8, but union activists said that many workers did not receive the monetary support from the first and second phases of the government’s support scheme for transport professionals.
Despite signing up for the support program, 40% of workers did not receive their share of subsidies, union activists said, adding that they are working on referring all the relevant information to the authorities.
Workers also complained that the subsidies do not adequately cover the rise in fuel prices that the world has experienced lately, but that they also cannot raise prices to reflect that because of government support.
Some have also suggested subsidizing fuel prices instead and capping them for transport professionals, arguing this is a more reliable measure for protecting all the involved parties.
The support program was launched in April, with Morocco spending over MAD 300 million ($30 million) on a special program to support transport professionals.
The program was spurred on by a rising trend for fuel prices worldwide, as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine.
Fuel expenses can represent up to 70% of the expenditures taken on by drivers, meaning a price increase in diesel and gasoline can substantially affect the prices consumers end up paying.
Morocco’s government has also been supporting other products and commodities that saw a rise in prices, such as grains and gas.
Recently, textbook publishers have also expressed a desire to raise prices due to rising production costs, but the government expressed intentions to preserve the prices as a “national priority.”

252,Stabilizing Textbook Prices ‘A National Priority’ for Morocco,Publishers reportedly want to increase prices by 25% during the 2022-23 academic year.,Oussama Aamari,"June 06, 2022 9:46 p.m.","Rabat - Preserving the stability of school textbooks prices remains “a national priority,” Minister of Education Chakib Benmoussa said on Monday, in response to publishers’ desire to revise prices for the next school year.
In a forum organized by the Moroccan News Agency (MAP) under the theme “What roadmap makes for quality in public education?” the minister insisted on the importance of reducing profit margins and production costs.
The government is currently examining textbook publishers’ request to revise prices, he added, taking into account the increase in paper prices and other production costs on the global scale.
Adding that 70% of primary level textbooks are funded by the state as part of the Million Backpacks initiative, Benmoussa stressed that guaranteeing the books’ availability and finding answers for the potential price increase is a priority for the government.
Government Spokesperson Mustapha Baitas had previously stated that the government remains undecided on the price increase, acknowledging that they did receive requests from publishers.
The publishers reportedly want to increase prices by 25% for the 2022-2023 academic year, which could place a burden on parents –especially in disadvantaged families– amid steady price rises for other essential products and commodities.
There were similar increases in book and tuition prices in 2018, which parents heavily protested. School supplies cost families as much as MAD 4,000 ($400) that year, a steep price for the average Moroccan family.
Food products such as grain and oil and fuel like diesel and gasoline have seen a steady increase over the past few months, as global markets remain in crisis mode.
Supply chain disruptions caused by theCOVID-19 crisis, the conflict in Ukraine, and climate change have all contributed to rising prices across the board. Amid the ensuing confusion and panic over skyrocketing market prices,  Moroccan citizens and politicians -- especially opposition MPs -- alike say that the government’s duty is to do everything it can to protect citizens’ purchasing power.

253,India Faces Backlash Over Officials’ Derogatory Comments About Islam,Critics and watchers of India maintain that Islamophobia has been on the rise in the country since the Hindu nationalist party BJP took the helm in 2014.,Aya Benazizi,"June 06, 2022 5:05 p.m.","Rabat - India is facing a major diplomatic backlash from Muslim-majority countries after top officials from the country’s ruling Hindu nationalist party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made derogatory remarks about Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.
The senior officials’ blasphemous comments drew the ire of many Arab countries, leaving New Delhi scrambling to limit the harmful impact of the country’s latest anti-Islam scandal.
In response to the offensive, Islamophobic comments by senior BJP officials Nupur Sharma and Naveen Kumar Jindal, a number of Arab countries have submitted official objections against India. 
The outpouring of outrage began last week when the two BJP members made remarks that were seen as insulting to Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha.
During a televised debate on the vexed Gyanvapi mosque controversy, Sharma made derogatory comments about Prophet Muhammad and his wife Aisha’s age. 
Her remarks sparked controversy, prompting multiple protests from Muslim groups in India, with reports later indicating that around 40 individuals, including police officers, were hurt during the protests in the city of Kanpur. 
Several First Information Reports (FIR) were filed against Sharma for infringing on religious emotions during her now-notorious television debate. The first FIR was registered by the Mumbai Police at the behest of the Islamist group Raza Academy, while the second was filed on June 1 by the Mumbra police in Thane based on a complaint by Mohammad Gufran Khan, a school teacher.

After being expelled from BJP, Sharma issued an apology on Sunday, stressing that her intention was not to hurt anyone. “If my words have caused discomfort or hurt religious feelings of anyone whatsoever, I hereby unconditionally withdraw my statement,” she said in a tweet.
Jindal, for his part, made provocative statements about Prophet Muhammad on Twitter on June 1. In response, social media users launched a campaign on Twitter under the hashtag “Arrest Naveen Jindal.” Faced with a torrent of backlash, the BJP official later deleted his tweet.
After he was suspended from the BJP, Jindal posted another tweet yesterday urging everyone to not make his address public as he was getting death threats on social media. “I have a special request to all, please do not make my address public, threats to kill me and my family are being given continuously on social media too,” he said.
Amid the social media melee, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran have all requested an apology from India’s government for tolerating insulting, anti-Islam statements from senior officials of the country’s ruling political party.
The BJP did not take any action against Jindal and Sharma until Sunday, after the governments of Qatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Iran summoned Indian ambassadors in their respective countries for clarification. 
In a bid to assuage the backlash it has been experiencing on the diplomatic front, India’s ruling, Hindu nationalist party banned Sharma and expelled Jindal. The party notably issued an unusual statement in which it “strongly denounces disrespect to any religious personalities,” a decision that Qatar and Kuwait applauded.
In addition to the strong condemnation by governments of Muslim-majority countries, many on social media have launched campaigns calling to boycott Indian products as a way of expressing their anger toward the Indian government for accommodating anti-Islam sentiments.
According to Al Jazeera, Indian products were removed from shelves in certain Kuwaiti shops on Monday.
Aggressive reactions to aggressive statements
Because offending Prophet Muhammad is a red line for Muslims, Muslim-majority countries were outraged by India’s offensive Islamophobic statements.
Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Soltan bin Saad Al-Muraikhi warned in a statement that “these insulting remarks would lead to incitement of religious hatred, and offend more than two billion Muslims around the world.”
Meanwhile, Kuwait cautioned that if the statements were not punished, India would experience “an increase of extremism and hatred.”
Doha, on the other hand, is expecting “a public apology and immediate condemnation of these remarks” from the Indian government.
Saudi Arabia and Iran also submitted complaints with India, while the Jeddha-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation stated the statements came in a “context of intensifying hatred and abuse toward Islam in India and systematic practices against Muslims.”
Pakistan, for its part, summoned an Indian envoy on Monday to express Islamabad’s “strong condemnation.” This came a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif claimed the BJP officials’ remarks were “hurtful” and that “India under [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi is trampling religious liberties and harassing Muslims.”
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said in a statement: “These insults come in the context of the increasing intensity in hatred of and insults to Islam in India and the systematic harassment of Muslims.” 
So far, New Delhi has made no comment on the Arab states’ objections, but the Indian Foreign Ministry on Monday dismissed the OIC’s views as “unwarranted” and “narrow-minded.”
The Indian embassies in Qatar and Doha issued a statement on Sunday, saying that harsh measures had already been taken against individuals who made the disparaging remarks against Islam. Both declarations notably insisted that the sentiments voiced against the Prophet Muhammad and Islam were not those of the Indian government and were expressed by “fringe elements.”

255,UM6P’s Science Week: Are We Ready for a Transhumanist Future?,"In the “era of transhumanism,” renowned scientists evoked the importance of transhumanist ethics that will shape the post-human age.",Oumaima Latrech,"June 03, 2022 10:11 a.m.","Morocco’s Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) hosted today a colloquium to shed light on artificial intelligence in the era of transhumanism in response to growing enthusiasm for scientific research and digital transformation among Moroccan youth in recent years. 
Themed “transhumanism, human enhancement: utopia or nightmare?,” the colloquium comes as part of UM6P’s “Week of Science” event held from May 28 to June 5 in the university’s two campuses of Laayoune and Benguerir.
“Transhumanism” refers to a movement devoted to promoting the research and development of robust human-enhancement technologies.
With transhumanism becoming an increasingly powerful concept worldwide, Morocco has embarked on a journey to keep up with the rapid pace of emerging technology and ways to introduce them in education.
The 2022 Science Week is also marked by the celebration of the bicentenary of Louis Pasteur, a French chemist and microbiologist and one of the pioneer founders of medical microbiology.
This year’s edition comes, as UM6P’s President Hicham El Habti recalled, in a context where science has proven that it is essential to save humanity. El Habti considers this evidence to be reflected in the work of the eminent Pasteur, whose work was highlighted during the first two days of the event.

With an aim of reshaping education in Morocco and across Africa, the UM6P put technology and science at the forefront of its work. This policy has enabled the university to establish several programs focused on robotic research, machine learning, computer science, and artificial intelligence in a time span of five years.
Although artificial intelligence threatens human autonomy, El Habti argued that it has enhanced the effectiveness of human efforts. He emphasizes that it both makes life easier and promises a potential tool for solving some of the world’s most critical challenges such as improving wildlife conservation and detecting epidemics and outbreaks.
“If transhumanism is becoming more and more a contentious topic, it is because the technology has now reached a turning point in its development,” he said.
Technologization and artificialization
Ever since renowned experts worldwide began exploring the potential of biotechnology, human life expectancy has increased over the last century. 
According to statistics from the US National Institute on Aging, the average life expectancy for babies born in 1900 was only 47 years, but in 1998, it had risen to 79 years.
In recent decades, many medical and tech-driven businesses have invented state-of-the-art technology to enable people to live longer and healthier, while also increasing the world’s understanding of biology.
That said, El Habti pointed out that through the “Week of Science,” panelists and experts will elucidate scientific approaches related to the ethics of transhumanism, the “post-human era,” and machine learning.
The objective is to acquaint the audience, consisting mainly of students, with the latest scientific advances in their respective fields and prepare them for world-class, practical, and socially relevant research.
French writer and economic and social theorist Jacques Attali delivered a presentation about the “ethics of human artificialization,” a concept which results from urbanization and the expansion of infrastructure.
In a statement to Morocco World News, Attali raised concerns about the artificialization of soils since the change in land use can be “of a great risk and can be damaging to the environment and agriculture. ” 
Thereby, artificialization and technical progress sometimes have extremely positive sides but there are dangerous derivatives that can lead to disasters, he added.  Attali emphasized the need to focus on recovery efforts of key sectors including health, education, and renewable energy within the framework of what he calls “the economy of life.”
Digital transformation in education
As teaching has rapidly evolved in recent times, especially during national lockdowns and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Morocco appears to have understood the importance of being equipped with advanced technologies and sped up the adoption of digital tools and platforms.
Speaking at the opening of the colloquium, Morocco’s Minister of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation Abdellatif Miraoui expressed his hope to see similar events held in all Moroccan universities to further raise awareness about the importance of science.
Generation Z and Alpha are not only climbing a longer academic ladder, but they are also disrupting old-fashioned learning methods in higher education, by emphasizing more on visual-learning and hands-on experience.
Aware of the importance of digital learning, Minister Miraoui spoke on the importance of “adapting artificial intelligence in pedagogical activities to allow young people to learn faster in a different sitting, while also providing teachers with the tools needed to improve their teaching methods.”
Like elsewhere, Moroccan professors have also had to go through different types of teaching during the pandemic, ranging from in-person, to online classes, and hybrid versions. 
Although the system still needs improvement to close the gap between Morocco and developed nations in terms of technology-based education, Miraoui remains positive about the ongoing evolution the country is experiencing to accelerate digital transformation.
With a focus on shifting existing teaching-learning practices, the Moroccan minister highlighted that the country has put the use of digital technology in schools among its priorities through the National Plan to Accelerate the Transformation of the Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation Ecosystem (ESRI 2030 PACT).
Morocco has invested millions of dollars in AI-based solutions and tech-solutions, and implemented several other initiatives to digitize the work of not only the education sector, but also healthcare, automotive, renewable energy, and public administrations.
The kingdom appears to be preparing itself for a new scientific and innovative era, and strives to provide young Moroccan leaders and scientists with the latest technology to become world-class professionals in their respective fields.

256,Morocco Has Not Yet Decided on Potential Increase in School Book Prices,"The government spokesperson also commented on the cabinet’s position on increases in commodities, claiming that it is doing “what it could” to avoid crises.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 02, 2022 2:09 p.m.","Rabat - The government has not yet decided on the increase in school books prices for the upcoming academic season, Government Spokesperson Mustapha Baitas said on Thursday.
Baitas, who also serves as Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of parliamentary relations, made his remark during a press briefing during the weekly government council held in Rabat.
The minister acknowledged that the government received a request from publishers, requesting to impose an increase in school book prices.
The statement followed media reports, suggesting that publishers want to see a 25% increase in the prices of school books during the 2022-2023 academic year.
Publishers complained about increased prices of basic materials but the “government is still studying the case and will make its decision soon,” Baitas said.
An increase in the price of school textbooks could add up to growing public discontent amid the already extremely high prices in commodities.
Parents have already protested an increase in textbook prices in 2018. During that year, school supplies cost parents as much as MAD 3,000 to MAD 4,000.
The rise in prices did not just affect textbooks but also tuition fees.
Moroccan social media users frequently take to online platforms to protest recent skyrocketing prices of commodities and the resulting drop in purchasing power.
Gasoline is also among the products that remain highly impacted by the crisis. Diesel and gasoline prices per liter are ranging between MAD 15 and MAD 14, sparking public outrage.
Baitas attempted to address people’s concerns, saying that Morocco remains dependent on purchasing gas from the international market. International markets are currently in crisis due to fractured post-COVID-19 supply chains, climate change and the conflict in Ukraine.
He said that price increases covering commodities are due to this global context. “This is not an excuse. The government is doing what it can and will not fail to do more to avoid such crises.”

As the event’s original venue in Casablanca is now operating as a hospital to accommodate COVID-19 patients,  Moroccan authorities decided to hold this year’s SIEL take in the Moroccan capital from June 3 to 12.
The choice of Rabat aims to shed light on the city’s cultural assets as the city has been undergoing major development projects since 2015 as part of the “Rabat, City of Lights and Morocco's Cultural Capital” initiative.
African literature will be in the spotlight in this year’s fair, and Bensaid said on Friday that the decision is in line with King Mohammed VI’s vision to promote south-south cooperation and Africa’s cultural heritage and values.
While pleading for the launch of a “real cultural dynamic” across Morocco, the Moroccan minister said that the 2022 book fair “is an illustration of the joint action to be undertaken to this end.”
He further told local media that “it has not yet been decided” whether next year’s SIEL will return to Casablanca, its initial host city.
With Rabat becoming a center of cultural influence at the national level, President of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra Regional Council Rachid El Abdi has pledged to boost strategic partnerships with various stakeholders to develop the Moroccan capital’s cultural appeal, support the local art industry, and preserve the region’s cultural heritage.
Meanwhile, Cameroonian Ambassador to Morocco Mouhamadou Youssifou stressed that the 2022 SIEL “brings together different book publishing companies from Africa, the Arab region and the world as a whole.”
During a meeting, the cultural ministry and the regional council signed an agreement aimed at boosting the cultural offer of the region.
The 2021 SIEL fair was suspended due to the COVID pandemic.
Morocco’s 2020 international book fair featured 703 exhibitors, and exhibits from all over the world featured more than 100,000 works.

261,"English, Innovation at the Center of Moroccan Education Reforms",The Moroccan government’s work in promoting English aligns with the growing interest of Moroccan youth in the language.,Souad Anouar,"May 25, 2022 1:07 p.m.","Rabat - Moroccan Minister of National Education, Pre-School, and Sports Chakib Benmoussa participated this week in the world’s largest gathering of education in London, where he reiterated Morocco’s interest in cooperating with the UK’s higher education institutes and the British council to promote the English language and educational and cultural exchange between Rabat and London.
Benmoussa participated in the three-day Education World Forum (EWF) from May 22 to 25 to share insights on prospects of cooperation between Morocco and the UK in the education and culture sectors. 
The Moroccan minister addressed the EWF participants on Tuesday, making him the second Moroccan and Maghreb Minister of Education to do so.  
Benmoussa discussed Morocco’s Roadmap for Education and its alignment with the New Development Model which calls for students' and teachers’ capacity-building and the creation of modern, inclusive, and innovative educational and vocational establishments. 
Addressing this year’s theme, “Education: building forward together; stronger, bolder, better?,” Benmoussa delivered a speech in the presence of senior officials from UNESCO, the World Bank, OECD, and the British Council. As well as experts and educational pioneers, more than 112 education ministers attended the international event.     
On the sidelines of the EWF, Benmoussa took part in a series of bilateral meetings with British stakeholders in the education sector and called for the strengthening of educational and cultural exchange between London and Rabat. He further supervised preparations for the upcoming opening of a branch campus of Coventry University in Morocco.    
Organized by the British Council in Morocco, in coordination with the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), Benmoussa’s visit underpins the educational and cultural pillar of the UK-Morocco Strategic Dialogue.

In December, the UK Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Liz Truss and her Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita affirmed their commitment to capitalize on the Moroccan youth’s interest in the English language and UK-inspired education. 
They spoke of creating new opportunities for learning the English language, training English teachers, as well as furthering research collaboration and transnational education. 
Morocco and the UK have notably established a Higher Education Commission to consolidate deepening educational and cultural exchange as well as support the Moroccan student community in the UK which annually grows by 1,000 members. 
In March, the commission’s 4th meeting concluded with the signing of two partnership agreements between Moroccan and UK institutions as well as a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the UK’s Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) and Morocco’s National Agency of Evaluation and Quality Assurance (ANEAQ). 
The agreements called for the promotion and implementation of innovative, English-speaking, and quality programs within Moroccan universities.
Promotion of the English language in Morocco
As Morocco partners with British institutions to promote the English language among its youth, the idea of replacing French with English has been at the center of public debate around the reform of Morocco’s education system.
Despite the increasing popularity of English among young Moroccans, recent studies have confirmed some concerns over Morocco’s readiness to shift to English teaching,  notably reporting the country’s “low” ranking in the English proficiency index. In 2021, Morocco ranked 71th (out of 112) in the index. 
Yet the growing interest of Moroccan youth in the English language and culture provides a promising future for the foreign language in the North African country. 
The British Council in Morocco, for instance, noted in its 2021 “Shift to English” report that “English is expected to become Morocco’s primary foreign language in the next five years, as well as the foreign language most widely spoken among youth.”
The report concluded that 37% of English-speaking participants learned the language in schools or in training institutes (6%). The rest were self-taught either through online exposure to the language (17%) or with the help of language applications (7%).
Moroccan institutions’ willingness to promote the English language, the increase in British council representations in Morocco, and the growing interest of Moroccan youth in English as a complementary or alternative to French provide a strong ground for the internationalization of the Moroccan education system and the modernization of the job market to further make Moroccan graduates competitive on the global stage.

263,Ministry of Education Launches Platform to Reform Public Schools,The platform seeks to collect people's opinions on ways to provide quality education for the growing population.,Oumaima Latrech,"May 24, 2022 1:40 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco's Ministry of National Education, Preschool, and Sports has launched a new platform as part of its work to reform public schools.
“Madrastna,” the newly launched platform, is accessible to all, and seeks to collect Moroccans' opinions and suggestions on ways to improve the Moroccan educational system. In a statement, the ministry noted that citizens can take part in a nationwide consultation to improve public schools by filling out a form on the new platform.
The ministry also called for wide-spreading access to the form with all stakeholders, associations of parents, students' guardians, and everyone involved in the education ecosystem with an aim of actively contributing to the reform of Moroccan public schools.
It said the platform is part of Morocco's efforts to provide quality education, boost students' innovation, and enhance their skills to enable them to enter the job market.
The country has also launched an online platform to accompany Moroccan students returning from Ukraine, by giving them access to documents related to their studies in Ukrainian universities.
Moroccans were the second-largest community of international students in Ukraine but over 8000 Moroccan students left the country after Russia's invasion in late February.
Upon returning from Ukraine, Moroccan students have been facing significant challenges and the education ministry has also been exploring ways to integrate them within Moroccan public universities.
Morocco has also expressed readiness to cooperate with international organizations such as UNESCO and work toward achieving Goal 4 of the UN’s sustainable development program (SDGs).
The SDG4 seeks to achieve quality education worldwide, with a mission of ""ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.""
Despite constant efforts to improve education across the country, a recent report from the Moroccan Association for the Improvement of the Quality of Education (AMAQUEN) has found that most students in secondary school “do not deserve” to progress further in the education system.

The ministry noted that second-year baccalaureate students in the literature department will sit exams for literature-based subjects on June 23 and 24.
The results of the baccalaureate exams will be announced on July 1 while the retake session is set between July 15 to 19 for all branches. The results of the second session will be out on July 22, the ministry added.
Meanwhile, students across Morocco will sit for the regional baccalaureate exams between June 15 and 16. Literature majors will take the exams on June 17-18, while the retake session of the first year baccalaureate is scheduled for July 13 and 14 for all majors.
Middle schoolers will have the ninth-grade exams on July 4-5, while sixth-grade students in primary schools will sit their final exams on June 5.
Last year, the success rate in the regular session for the national baccalaureate exam reached 68.43%, compared to 63,08% in 2020. 
Morocco adopted remote education after the government announced a state of emergency in March 2020.
In September 2021, the ministry postponed the beginning of the school year, extending the entry by a month.
Morocco postponed in-person classes for almost a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and reinstated in-person education in 2021. 
When parents were given options to choose between remote learning and face-to-face classes, most of them chose in-person education.
As Morocco faced a worrying surge in COVID-related cases earlier this year, many students urged schools to schedule exams of the first semester online amid concerns over the safety of in-person exams due to the then alarming health situation.

267,UM6P’s Science Week: Are We Ready for a Transhumanist Future?,"In the “era of transhumanism,” renowned scientists evoked the importance of transhumanist ethics that will shape the post-human age.",Oumaima Latrech,"June 03, 2022 10:11 a.m.","Morocco’s Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) hosted today a colloquium to shed light on artificial intelligence in the era of transhumanism in response to growing enthusiasm for scientific research and digital transformation among Moroccan youth in recent years. 
Themed “transhumanism, human enhancement: utopia or nightmare?,” the colloquium comes as part of UM6P’s “Week of Science” event held from May 28 to June 5 in the university’s two campuses of Laayoune and Benguerir.
“Transhumanism” refers to a movement devoted to promoting the research and development of robust human-enhancement technologies.
With transhumanism becoming an increasingly powerful concept worldwide, Morocco has embarked on a journey to keep up with the rapid pace of emerging technology and ways to introduce them in education.
The 2022 Science Week is also marked by the celebration of the bicentenary of Louis Pasteur, a French chemist and microbiologist and one of the pioneer founders of medical microbiology.
This year’s edition comes, as UM6P’s President Hicham El Habti recalled, in a context where science has proven that it is essential to save humanity. El Habti considers this evidence to be reflected in the work of the eminent Pasteur, whose work was highlighted during the first two days of the event.

With an aim of reshaping education in Morocco and across Africa, the UM6P put technology and science at the forefront of its work. This policy has enabled the university to establish several programs focused on robotic research, machine learning, computer science, and artificial intelligence in a time span of five years.
Although artificial intelligence threatens human autonomy, El Habti argued that it has enhanced the effectiveness of human efforts. He emphasizes that it both makes life easier and promises a potential tool for solving some of the world’s most critical challenges such as improving wildlife conservation and detecting epidemics and outbreaks.
“If transhumanism is becoming more and more a contentious topic, it is because the technology has now reached a turning point in its development,” he said.
Technologization and artificialization
Ever since renowned experts worldwide began exploring the potential of biotechnology, human life expectancy has increased over the last century. 
According to statistics from the US National Institute on Aging, the average life expectancy for babies born in 1900 was only 47 years, but in 1998, it had risen to 79 years.
In recent decades, many medical and tech-driven businesses have invented state-of-the-art technology to enable people to live longer and healthier, while also increasing the world’s understanding of biology.
That said, El Habti pointed out that through the “Week of Science,” panelists and experts will elucidate scientific approaches related to the ethics of transhumanism, the “post-human era,” and machine learning.
The objective is to acquaint the audience, consisting mainly of students, with the latest scientific advances in their respective fields and prepare them for world-class, practical, and socially relevant research.
French writer and economic and social theorist Jacques Attali delivered a presentation about the “ethics of human artificialization,” a concept which results from urbanization and the expansion of infrastructure.
In a statement to Morocco World News, Attali raised concerns about the artificialization of soils since the change in land use can be “of a great risk and can be damaging to the environment and agriculture. ” 
Thereby, artificialization and technical progress sometimes have extremely positive sides but there are dangerous derivatives that can lead to disasters, he added.  Attali emphasized the need to focus on recovery efforts of key sectors including health, education, and renewable energy within the framework of what he calls “the economy of life.”
Digital transformation in education
As teaching has rapidly evolved in recent times, especially during national lockdowns and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Morocco appears to have understood the importance of being equipped with advanced technologies and sped up the adoption of digital tools and platforms.
Speaking at the opening of the colloquium, Morocco’s Minister of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation Abdellatif Miraoui expressed his hope to see similar events held in all Moroccan universities to further raise awareness about the importance of science.
Generation Z and Alpha are not only climbing a longer academic ladder, but they are also disrupting old-fashioned learning methods in higher education, by emphasizing more on visual-learning and hands-on experience.
Aware of the importance of digital learning, Minister Miraoui spoke on the importance of “adapting artificial intelligence in pedagogical activities to allow young people to learn faster in a different sitting, while also providing teachers with the tools needed to improve their teaching methods.”
Like elsewhere, Moroccan professors have also had to go through different types of teaching during the pandemic, ranging from in-person, to online classes, and hybrid versions. 
Although the system still needs improvement to close the gap between Morocco and developed nations in terms of technology-based education, Miraoui remains positive about the ongoing evolution the country is experiencing to accelerate digital transformation.
With a focus on shifting existing teaching-learning practices, the Moroccan minister highlighted that the country has put the use of digital technology in schools among its priorities through the National Plan to Accelerate the Transformation of the Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation Ecosystem (ESRI 2030 PACT).
Morocco has invested millions of dollars in AI-based solutions and tech-solutions, and implemented several other initiatives to digitize the work of not only the education sector, but also healthcare, automotive, renewable energy, and public administrations.
The kingdom appears to be preparing itself for a new scientific and innovative era, and strives to provide young Moroccan leaders and scientists with the latest technology to become world-class professionals in their respective fields.

268,Morocco Has Not Yet Decided on Potential Increase in School Book Prices,"The government spokesperson also commented on the cabinet’s position on increases in commodities, claiming that it is doing “what it could” to avoid crises.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 02, 2022 2:09 p.m.","Rabat - The government has not yet decided on the increase in school books prices for the upcoming academic season, Government Spokesperson Mustapha Baitas said on Thursday.
Baitas, who also serves as Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of parliamentary relations, made his remark during a press briefing during the weekly government council held in Rabat.
The minister acknowledged that the government received a request from publishers, requesting to impose an increase in school book prices.
The statement followed media reports, suggesting that publishers want to see a 25% increase in the prices of school books during the 2022-2023 academic year.
Publishers complained about increased prices of basic materials but the “government is still studying the case and will make its decision soon,” Baitas said.
An increase in the price of school textbooks could add up to growing public discontent amid the already extremely high prices in commodities.
Parents have already protested an increase in textbook prices in 2018. During that year, school supplies cost parents as much as MAD 3,000 to MAD 4,000.
The rise in prices did not just affect textbooks but also tuition fees.
Moroccan social media users frequently take to online platforms to protest recent skyrocketing prices of commodities and the resulting drop in purchasing power.
Gasoline is also among the products that remain highly impacted by the crisis. Diesel and gasoline prices per liter are ranging between MAD 15 and MAD 14, sparking public outrage.
Baitas attempted to address people’s concerns, saying that Morocco remains dependent on purchasing gas from the international market. International markets are currently in crisis due to fractured post-COVID-19 supply chains, climate change and the conflict in Ukraine.
He said that price increases covering commodities are due to this global context. “This is not an excuse. The government is doing what it can and will not fail to do more to avoid such crises.”

African literature will be in the spotlight in this year’s fair, and Bensaid said on Friday that the decision is in line with King Mohammed VI’s vision to promote south-south cooperation and Africa’s cultural heritage and values.
While pleading for the launch of a “real cultural dynamic” across Morocco, the Moroccan minister said that the 2022 book fair “is an illustration of the joint action to be undertaken to this end.”
He further told local media that “it has not yet been decided” whether next year’s SIEL will return to Casablanca, its initial host city.
With Rabat becoming a center of cultural influence at the national level, President of the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra Regional Council Rachid El Abdi has pledged to boost strategic partnerships with various stakeholders to develop the Moroccan capital’s cultural appeal, support the local art industry, and preserve the region’s cultural heritage.
Meanwhile, Cameroonian Ambassador to Morocco Mouhamadou Youssifou stressed that the 2022 SIEL “brings together different book publishing companies from Africa, the Arab region and the world as a whole.”
During a meeting, the cultural ministry and the regional council signed an agreement aimed at boosting the cultural offer of the region.
The 2021 SIEL fair was suspended due to the COVID pandemic.
Morocco’s 2020 international book fair featured 703 exhibitors, and exhibits from all over the world featured more than 100,000 works.

After a successful edition last year, the UM6P is hoping to further highlight the most impactful scientific discoveries through a series of conferences, panels, and workshops to address emerging health challenges amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
This year’s edition coincides with the 200th birthday of the French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur, renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization.
The UM6P will organize the first “Week of Science” at its Laayoune campus between May 28-29, with the presence of several panelists such as Fouad Laroui, Gabriel Makla, Mohammed Maouhoub, and Hassan Talibi.
UM6P’s School of Medical Sciences (ISSB-P) will organize the Bicentenary of Louis Pasteur as a kickoff of the Week of Science, with a two-day selection of lectures, conferences and projections, the university said in a Linkedin post.
The two-day event will mainly focus on health- and society-related topics as well as astronomy and philosophy of sciences, in addition to hosting a music and poetry concert of the Hassani music, a musical style that has been long rooted in the Sahrawi culture in southern Morocco.
Meanwhile, UM6P’s Benguerir campus will host the “Week of Science” from May 30 to June 5, under different themes that entail the role of social science, political science, anthropology, and other scientific study areas.
UM6P’s President Hicham El Habti will be attending the renowned event alongside Abdellatif Miraoui, Minister of Higher Education and Ryad Mezzour, Minister of Industry.

Andre Azoulay, senior adviser to king Mohammed VI, will also be hosting a conference on the first day of the event.
Amid the emerging need to adopt innovative approaches to meet international standards, panelists will debate over the benefits and the challenges of artificial intelligence, the ethics of transhumanism, and human enhancement technologies.
During last year’s “Week of Science” conferences, attendees and students were engaged in discussions about several scientific approaches from Islam’s perspective to tackle the ambiguities surrounding religion and science.

273,"English, Innovation at the Center of Moroccan Education Reforms",The Moroccan government’s work in promoting English aligns with the growing interest of Moroccan youth in the language.,Souad Anouar,"May 25, 2022 1:07 p.m.","Rabat - Moroccan Minister of National Education, Pre-School, and Sports Chakib Benmoussa participated this week in the world’s largest gathering of education in London, where he reiterated Morocco’s interest in cooperating with the UK’s higher education institutes and the British council to promote the English language and educational and cultural exchange between Rabat and London.
Benmoussa participated in the three-day Education World Forum (EWF) from May 22 to 25 to share insights on prospects of cooperation between Morocco and the UK in the education and culture sectors. 
The Moroccan minister addressed the EWF participants on Tuesday, making him the second Moroccan and Maghreb Minister of Education to do so.  
Benmoussa discussed Morocco’s Roadmap for Education and its alignment with the New Development Model which calls for students' and teachers’ capacity-building and the creation of modern, inclusive, and innovative educational and vocational establishments. 
Addressing this year’s theme, “Education: building forward together; stronger, bolder, better?,” Benmoussa delivered a speech in the presence of senior officials from UNESCO, the World Bank, OECD, and the British Council. As well as experts and educational pioneers, more than 112 education ministers attended the international event.     
On the sidelines of the EWF, Benmoussa took part in a series of bilateral meetings with British stakeholders in the education sector and called for the strengthening of educational and cultural exchange between London and Rabat. He further supervised preparations for the upcoming opening of a branch campus of Coventry University in Morocco.    
Organized by the British Council in Morocco, in coordination with the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), Benmoussa’s visit underpins the educational and cultural pillar of the UK-Morocco Strategic Dialogue.

In December, the UK Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Liz Truss and her Moroccan counterpart Nasser Bourita affirmed their commitment to capitalize on the Moroccan youth’s interest in the English language and UK-inspired education. 
They spoke of creating new opportunities for learning the English language, training English teachers, as well as furthering research collaboration and transnational education. 
Morocco and the UK have notably established a Higher Education Commission to consolidate deepening educational and cultural exchange as well as support the Moroccan student community in the UK which annually grows by 1,000 members. 
In March, the commission’s 4th meeting concluded with the signing of two partnership agreements between Moroccan and UK institutions as well as a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the UK’s Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) and Morocco’s National Agency of Evaluation and Quality Assurance (ANEAQ). 
The agreements called for the promotion and implementation of innovative, English-speaking, and quality programs within Moroccan universities.
Promotion of the English language in Morocco
As Morocco partners with British institutions to promote the English language among its youth, the idea of replacing French with English has been at the center of public debate around the reform of Morocco’s education system.
Despite the increasing popularity of English among young Moroccans, recent studies have confirmed some concerns over Morocco’s readiness to shift to English teaching,  notably reporting the country’s “low” ranking in the English proficiency index. In 2021, Morocco ranked 71th (out of 112) in the index. 
Yet the growing interest of Moroccan youth in the English language and culture provides a promising future for the foreign language in the North African country. 
The British Council in Morocco, for instance, noted in its 2021 “Shift to English” report that “English is expected to become Morocco’s primary foreign language in the next five years, as well as the foreign language most widely spoken among youth.”
The report concluded that 37% of English-speaking participants learned the language in schools or in training institutes (6%). The rest were self-taught either through online exposure to the language (17%) or with the help of language applications (7%).
Moroccan institutions’ willingness to promote the English language, the increase in British council representations in Morocco, and the growing interest of Moroccan youth in English as a complementary or alternative to French provide a strong ground for the internationalization of the Moroccan education system and the modernization of the job market to further make Moroccan graduates competitive on the global stage.

The agreement “reflects the CNRST’s desire to further promote scientific research and innovation by providing teacher-researchers with new resources and expertise to carry out new innovative projects,” El Alami added.
The FRQ said that it will release further information about the projects later this month, on May 31.
In a bid to further officialize the new partnership, a Quebec scientific delegation led by Remi Quiron paid a visit to Morocco’s Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation, and Research (MAScIR). The delegation consisted of representatives of the Quebec government and academic, technical, and research institutions and universities. 
MAScIR’s executive director Nawal Chraibi welcomed the delegation into the foundation’s technology platform and showcased its innovative projects and achievements in the fields of medical and plant biotechnology, microelectronics, and nanotechnology.
Chraibi highlighted the foundation’s role in the advancement of applied research in Morocco and expressed its willingness to support Quebec scientific institutions and operators wishing to settle and develop partnerships in the North African country.
The visit was an opportunity for the foundation and the Quebec delegation to discuss their shared priorities “in terms of applied research, modes of business-university collaboration, technology transfer and development,” MAScIR said in a press release.

275,Ministry of Education Launches Platform to Reform Public Schools,The platform seeks to collect people's opinions on ways to provide quality education for the growing population.,Oumaima Latrech,"May 24, 2022 1:40 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco's Ministry of National Education, Preschool, and Sports has launched a new platform as part of its work to reform public schools.
“Madrastna,” the newly launched platform, is accessible to all, and seeks to collect Moroccans' opinions and suggestions on ways to improve the Moroccan educational system. In a statement, the ministry noted that citizens can take part in a nationwide consultation to improve public schools by filling out a form on the new platform.
The ministry also called for wide-spreading access to the form with all stakeholders, associations of parents, students' guardians, and everyone involved in the education ecosystem with an aim of actively contributing to the reform of Moroccan public schools.
It said the platform is part of Morocco's efforts to provide quality education, boost students' innovation, and enhance their skills to enable them to enter the job market.
The country has also launched an online platform to accompany Moroccan students returning from Ukraine, by giving them access to documents related to their studies in Ukrainian universities.
Moroccans were the second-largest community of international students in Ukraine but over 8000 Moroccan students left the country after Russia's invasion in late February.
Upon returning from Ukraine, Moroccan students have been facing significant challenges and the education ministry has also been exploring ways to integrate them within Moroccan public universities.
Morocco has also expressed readiness to cooperate with international organizations such as UNESCO and work toward achieving Goal 4 of the UN’s sustainable development program (SDGs).
The SDG4 seeks to achieve quality education worldwide, with a mission of ""ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.""
Despite constant efforts to improve education across the country, a recent report from the Moroccan Association for the Improvement of the Quality of Education (AMAQUEN) has found that most students in secondary school “do not deserve” to progress further in the education system.

The ministry noted that second-year baccalaureate students in the literature department will sit exams for literature-based subjects on June 23 and 24.
The results of the baccalaureate exams will be announced on July 1 while the retake session is set between July 15 to 19 for all branches. The results of the second session will be out on July 22, the ministry added.
Meanwhile, students across Morocco will sit for the regional baccalaureate exams between June 15 and 16. Literature majors will take the exams on June 17-18, while the retake session of the first year baccalaureate is scheduled for July 13 and 14 for all majors.
Middle schoolers will have the ninth-grade exams on July 4-5, while sixth-grade students in primary schools will sit their final exams on June 5.
Last year, the success rate in the regular session for the national baccalaureate exam reached 68.43%, compared to 63,08% in 2020. 
Morocco adopted remote education after the government announced a state of emergency in March 2020.
In September 2021, the ministry postponed the beginning of the school year, extending the entry by a month.
Morocco postponed in-person classes for almost a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and reinstated in-person education in 2021. 
When parents were given options to choose between remote learning and face-to-face classes, most of them chose in-person education.
As Morocco faced a worrying surge in COVID-related cases earlier this year, many students urged schools to schedule exams of the first semester online amid concerns over the safety of in-person exams due to the then alarming health situation.

280,UNESCO: Moroccan Girls Outperform Boys in Reading,"Despite governmental efforts, gender biases continue to limit girls' enrollment in scientific fields.",Souad Anouar,"Apr. 28, 2022 4:27 p.m.","Rabat - UNESCO has reported that Moroccan girls outperform boys in reading by 10 points. 
On Tuesday, UNESCO published its annual global education monitoring report, titled “Deepening the debate on those still left behind.” The report is based on analyzed data from 120 countries in primary and secondary education. 
The data shows that girls outperform boys in reading in primary education and in science in secondary education, particularly in middle and high-income countries. For instance, girls aged below 15-year-old from Lithuania and Norway perform 15% better in reading compared to their male counterparts. 
Commenting on the report, activist Malala Yousafzaico highlighted that “Girls are demonstrating how well they can do in school when they have access to education. But many, and particularly the most disadvantaged, are not getting the chance to learn at all. We shouldn’t be afraid of this potential. We should feed it and watch it grow.”
The report also noted that boys tend to perform better in mathematics in their early years, but the gender gap fades away as they age. Still, girls are less likely to pursue scientific careers due to existing gender biases related to women’s presence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.

Additionally, girls are less likely to get top marks in mathematics in 50 out of 54 countries.
In the MENA region, the study noted an increase in the share of women in the teaching workforce between 2000 and 2020. However, the presence of female teachers gradually decreases as the education level increases. 
In 2020, female teachers in the region represented 94% of the pre-primary level teaching force while constituting 52% of the secondary education one, up from 47% in 2000. 
While female representation in teaching helps counter discriminative discourses, civil society, schools -particularly private ones-, and teachers’ trade unions are major players in supporting girls’ education and promoting gender parity, UNESCO concluded.
In Morocco, the government has worked on improving the quality and accessibility of education to all citizens by implementing measures related to the development of pre-school quality standards and the fight against school dropouts in rural areas.  
However, the Moroccan public remains unsatisfied with the quality of educational services provided by public schools, pushing parents to enroll their children in costly private schools.

Students will also be required to receive a minimum B2 level - intermediate level - in the foreign language in which they pursue their program, such as French.
Those who already have the proficiency tests such as DALF and DELF for French or IELTS or TOEFL for English, will be given the opportunity - if they wish - to learn another language such as Chinese or Spanish, Miraoui noted.
The country’s decision to reduce the duration of medical training from seven to six years will also take effect in the new academic year for 2022-2023.
Through the global and inclusive reform, Miraoui said that his aim is “to raise the quality of our education to a very high level.”
The minister also spoke about the possibility of introducing cooperative education, also known as co-op, as a way to provide students with the know-how needed in the job market.
The co-op is a program that balances classroom theory with periods of practical, hands-on experience prior to graduation.

He highlighted the role of digital technology alongside the development of human resources and scientific research, to try to provide equal opportunities for students.
The Ministry of Education under the former government has previously announced that a 4-year bachelor degree would replace 3-year licence programs at public universities, but the new government has seemingly abandoned the idea.
Students who were enrolled in bachelor programs around the country would be redirected to different degrees, depending on their individual choices, according to Mustapha Baitas, spokesperson for Morocco’s government.
Baitas noted that a clear legal and educational framework are the main reason behind the abandonment.
In Morocco, although the teaching languages are mainly French or Arabic, many private and semi-private institutions offer degrees in English.
Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, and Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) in Benguerir are examples of private universities that offer English speaking courses.

285,Ranking: Mohammed V University of Rabat Best in Maghreb,This is the second year in a row it has won top spot in the ranking in Maghreb.,Oumaima Latrech,"Apr. 26, 2022 12:13 p.m.","Rabat - Mohammed V University in Rabat   is the best in the Maghreb, according to the latest annual ranking by the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR).
The CWUR listed 2,000 universities out of more than 19,000 academic institutions worldwide in its 2022-23 “Global 2000 list”
This is the second year in a row that Mohammed V University has been put in first place in the Maghreb.. 
The Rabat-based university comes 11th place in the MENA region and 950th globally, according to the report. 
Last week, Mohammed V University ranked as the 28th best in Africa and 1201th worldwide in the QA World University Rankings 2022.
In CWUR’s ranking, Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech comes in  1024th position worldwide, and second nationally, followed by Hassan II University of Casablanca (1068th), and Mohammed I University in Oujda (1090th).
The international ranking is based on four key indicators, namely the quality of research, the quality of training, employability of alumni, and faculty that have obtained international academic distinctions.
In North Africa, Egypt dominates the list with 20 universities, with Cairo University (531st), Ain Shams University (784th), and Mansoura University (932nd) occupying the top 3 positions in the country.

286,Morocco’s OFPPT Invests in Market Research to Boost Performance,Morocco’s national vocational training office plans to establish a roadmap to boost its efficiency and strengthen its position in the vocational training landscape.,Jihane Rahhou,"Apr. 26, 2022 10:41 a.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s national vocational training agency OFPPT has hired three consulting firms to conduct thorough market research on the service the institution offers. The study aims to strengthen the OFPPT’s position within Morocco’s training market.
The group of consulting and accounting firms OFPPT hired to put the research together includes Valyans, Ideo, and Grant Thornton, according to converging news reports.
The planned study is set to be completed in two phases and is projected to cost a total budget of MAD 2.9 million ($ 292,412). 
The first part of the study targets Morocco’s training ecosystem, including its current state, regulations, key players, and its potential, news reports indicate. In the second phase, meanwhile, the market study will target OFPPT and provide an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the institution’s approach, methods, and human resources. 
As well as assessing OFPPT’s performance on the national level, the study will also cross-examine the agency’s performance with similar institutions within similar markets. The main goal is to advise OFPPT on the best practices it needs to adopt to boost its performance and remain competitive in its sector.
With this market study, Morocco’s vocational training agency hopes to establish a roadmap and a plan of action to elevate its standing in the country’s vocational training landscape.
In recent years, Morocco has intensively invested in the national office of vocational training, with an aim to increase its appeal to Morocco’s youth population.
Within the 2022 fiscal year, Morocco has allocated over MAD 829 million ($91 million) to vocational training.
The 2022 budget represents a 138%  year-on-year increase from the 2021 fiscal year, which is a telling indication of the special attention the government is paying to the sector.
The government has equally boosted the management budget within the sector by 79.8%  in the past year. The budget reached MAD 365.25 million ($40 million) in the 2022 fiscal year. 
Within Morocco’s national strategies, vocational training is viewed as the cornerstone to combat unemployment and enhancing economic inclusion.
In 2016, Morocco launched a national strategy -- the National Vocational Training Strategy for 2021 --  with the aim of reforming higher education and vocational training.
The plan aims to prioritize vocational training to increase employability while bringing national training centers up to speed with the needs of today’s economy.
Another goal of the strategy is to reduce the number of students and ease the pressure on the already-packed public universities. Through a nationwide marketing campaign, the government hopes to encourage students to opt for market-oriented majors within vocational training centers.

287,Most Moroccan Scientific Publications are Written in English,The English language is also gaining rising popularity in Morocco beyond the academic sector.,Souad Anouar,"Apr. 25, 2022 1:39 p.m.","Rabat - A total of 95% of Moroccan human and social science publications in the international Scopus database were written in English in 2018, up from 74% over ten years.
The Scopus database is an international platform that provides access to hundreds of academic journals. 
While English-language publications from Morocco in the database increased between 2008 and 2019, French-written publications dropped from 22% to 5% in the same period, according to the Scopus database. 
Morocco’s Higher Council of Education, Training and Scientific Research noted in its April report that Moroccan publications on human and social sciences, including economics and management, did not exceed 7% of total publications in 2008-2018 in the Scopus database. 
The weak representation in the human and social sciences international databases is due to the prominence of Arabic in doctoral studies in Morocco, rather than in French or English, explained the council. 
In addition to citing Scopus, the council relied on the data of the Web of Science (WoS) database to study the progress and distribution of Moroccan academic writings in international publications. 
WoS echoed the Scopus findings while reporting different data. Moroccan publications in WoS were prominently in English, reaching 86.1% in 2008-2017, up from 65.6% in 1988-1997. 
The increase in English-written publications was accompanied by a drop in French-written publications from 33.9% between  1988 and1997 to 13.5% between 2008 and 2017. 
However, the language distribution varied with regard to human and social sciences publications (2008-2018) in WoS with English coming first (48.4%) followed by French (42.8%), Spanish (8.2%), and German (0.6%). 
The increase in Moroccan English-written academic publications reflects a rise in the popularity of the English language in Morocco particularly among youth. 
“English is expected to become Morocco’s primary foreign language in the next five years, as well as the foreign language most widely spoken among youth,” British Council in Morocco reported in April 2021. 
While the country’s ranking in English proficiency increased in 2021 to 71th out of 112, the country has a so-called “low” English proficiency.
Moroccan women in academics
Another prominent point raised in the council’s report is women’s participation in scientific research in various disciplines from medicine to sociology. 
According to WoS, women's participation in scientific production in Morocco reached 23.7% in 2017. 
The report further noted that women represented 25.9% of teacher-researchers in the country in 2017. As for women’s academic achievements, 36.6% of doctorate holders in Morocco were women in the same year. 
The percentage of female doctorate-holders (35%)  remains lower than the percentage of their male counterparts (65%) but Moroccan women have high representation in the two sectors of commerce and management (69%) and dentistry (64%), according to the council. 
The low participation of women in scientific research reflects one of the numerous structural issues in Moroccan higher education. 
The low investment in research and development is another prominent burden on the development of Moroccan scientific innovation. In 2016, Morocco allocated only 0.75% of its GDP to research and development despite the recommendation of the sector’s strategy for reform for 2015-2030 to increase spending to 1% in the short term to reach 1.5% in 2025 and 2% in 2030. 
This is further demonstrated in the country’s low innovative capacity, the report said, adding that the country has less than 10 Moroccan origin patents per one million habitants.

288,UM6P Organizes ‘Open Days’ in Laayoune for Baccalaureate Students,The event aimed to introduce senior high school students to UM6P’ focus on applied research and innovation and its scholarship offers for outstanding students.,Safaa Kasraoui,"Apr. 24, 2022 2:44 p.m.","Rabat - The Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) organized on Saturday in the southern Moroccan city of Laayoune its first Open Days program for the coming academic year. 
The event targeted outstanding students in their baccalaureate year from the region of Laayoune-Sakia-El Hamra.
The event took place at the African Research Institute for Sustainable Agriculture to shed light on the different training programs offered by the UM6P as well as scholarships for opportunities for outstanding students to enter the prestigious Moroccan university.
The event also served as an opportunity to exchange expertise and knowledge between students, UM6P professors, as well as visitors.
Abdeslam Bekrate, the governor of the Laayoune-Sakia El Hamra region and governor of the province of Laayoune, attended the event along with the president of the city’s Regional Council, Sidi Hamdi Ould Errachid.
As Laayoune is home to one of the UM6P research centers across Morocco, the event was also an opportunity for the students from Laayoune, Es-Semara, Boujdour, and Tarfaya to learn more about UM6P’s focus on applied research and innovation.
King Mohammed VI inaugurated UM6P’s Laayoune Research Center in 2016; the complex stretches over a land of 5,000 square meters.
“The UM6P Research Center includes three research units dedicated to biotechnology, renewable energies, water and the environment, and camel valorization. It includes a restaurant, a conference room, and a technology hall, all designed with the latest renewable technologies,” according to OCP’s Phosboucraa Foundation.
The event comes as the ongoing academic season is drawing to an end. Students awaiting graduation from the high-school final year (baccalaureate) are intensifying efforts to explore majors and programs they want to join as part of their higher education journey.
This June, second-year baccalaureate students are expected to sit for final exams that will determine their future trajectory in higher education.
The Education Ministry announced in September 2021 that second-year baccalaureate students in the literature branch will sit their exams from June 23 to 24 in 2022. Meanwhile, second-year science and technology baccalaureate students are expected to sit for exams from June 20 to 22, with the retake session scheduled for July 15 and 19.

289,Students Abandon Bachelor Programs After Failed Reforms,Students who were excited about the Bachelor program reform before expressed disappointment at its abandonment.,Oussama Aamari,"Apr. 23, 2022 11:07 a.m.","Rabat - Mustapha Baitas, spokesperson for Morocco’s government, confirmed on Thursday that students who were enrolled in bachelor programs around the country would be redirected to different degrees, depending on their individual choices.
Morocco’s Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research had previously announced that it would reform the system of higher education in Morocco into a Bachelor’s degree system, to make the degrees more appealing internationally.
The new government has seemingly abandoned the idea, however, with Baitas citing the absence of a clear legal and educational framework as the main reason behind the abandonment.
Students are being directed to other degrees such as the professional license programs in universities across the country.
Abdellatif Miraoui, Morocco’s Minister of Higher Education, had previously noted that the new ministry’s vision does not correspond completely with that of the previous ministry.
If the governmental transition following the 2021 elections is indeed to blame for the botched reforms, both students and citizens alike are likely to express disappointment in what was expected to be a path towards standardizing Moroccan degrees to international standards. 
This disappointment appears warranted, after the 2021 elections brought into power a coalition that emphasized its international focus, touted its more Anglophone skillset and its emphasis on a business-minded approach.

For international partners and educational institutions worldwide, the sudden abandonment of a promising Moroccan reform effort could potentially undermine faith in Moroccan educational standards and the ministries that control these standards.
Students who had previously enthusiastically welcomed the program voiced disappointment when the government said it would abandon the program.
A switch to the bachelor system from the license model was expected to lead to an improvement in students’ soft skills and foreign languages, which would in turn lead to higher employability in foreign countries, according to previous Minister of Higher Education Said Amzazi.

290,Morocco To Reduce Medical Training Requirement to 6 Years,The measure comes in response to the growing shortage of healthcare professionals in morocco.,Souad Anouar,"Feb. 18, 2022 12:46 p.m.","Rabat - Morocco’s Minister of Higher Education Abdellatif Miraoui has reported the governmental decision to reduce the duration of medical training in the country from seven to six years in a note to presidents of public universities. 
Morocco World News on February 18 obtained the note signed by Minister Miraoui. 
Miraoui indicated in the note that the reform aims to meet the objectives of Morocco’s New Development Model and the national project to extend health insurance (AMO) to every Moroccan.
To address current needs, the Moroccan government intends to reduce the training period for medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry students by one year. Thus, the students will train for six years instead of seven years to obtain their diploma. 
Additionally, the ministry announced an increase in admissions of medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry students. 
The minister stressed that all required financial and educational resources will be mobilized, through a contractual program between the government and universities concerned.
Morocco World News reached out to Abdellatif Miraoui for comment but did not receive a response.

In January, Morocco’s Minister of Health Khalid Ait Taleb reported that Moroccan hospitals have an “acute shortage” with only 32,000 doctors and 65,000 nurses operating in the sector serving nearly 37 million citizens and residents. 
It “is difficult to rapidly train [doctors] because only 1,200 doctors graduate a year,"" he added. 
To address the issue, the government plans to raise wages for health professionals in the public sector while trying to attract Moroccan doctors among its vast diaspora.  
In addition to that, health care officials serving under-staffed regions, known as “medical deserts,” are set to receive state aid or tax incentives, confirmed Ait Taleb.
The measures announced by Miraoui complement governmental efforts to address the shortage of healthcare professionals in Morocco.

291,Fez's Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University Ranked Best in Morocco,The Fez’s university maintained its position among Moroccan universities.,Issam Toutate,"Feb. 17, 2022 11:36 a.m.","Fez - Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Fez still ranks as the best university in Morocco, according to the Times Higher Education 2022 World University Rankings.
The university is still the only Moroccan higher education institution in the top 1,000 global rankings, keeping its place in the 801-1,000 section.
Fez's university was ranked the first university in Morocco for the fourth year in a row.
The 1,001+ section of the 2021 rankings included four other Moroccan universities: Ibn Tofail University in Kenitra, Hassan I University in Settat, Hassan II University in Casablanca, and Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech.
Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University's global rank declined in the past two years, compared to the 2020 World University Rankings when Fez's university appeared in the 601-800 section.
The Times Higher Education ranking considers five different criteria when evaluating universities: Teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international outlook.
Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University earned the highest score among Moroccan universities in terms of citations from the university’s work in other publications. Meanwhile, Ibn Tofail University scored the highest in industry income, and Cadi Ayyad University earned the best score in terms of international outlook.
On the global ladder, the University of Oxford remained in first place, followed by California Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Stanford University, and University of Cambridge.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, University of California Berkeley, Yale University, and University of Chicago complete, in order, for the top 10 of the 2022 World University Rankings.
Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University was founded in 1975 and is named after a Sultan of Morocco from the 18th century. 
The main campus is in Fez, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in northern Morocco, that was once the final destination on the famous gold trading route from Timbuktu.

Applicants must provide the commission with two of the following tests: a valid TOEFL score, the Graduate Record Examinations General Test (GRE) for most fields of study, and the Graduate Management Achievement Test (GMAT) for those majoring in Business Administration.
MACECE said it aims to find well-rounded applicants who are not only evaluated on their academic record, but also on their motivation for the program, and ambassadorial and leadership skills. 
Selected candidates will then be guided by AMIDEAST to apply for American universities.
According to MACECE, the scholarship will grant future leaders with strong academic performance and compelling skills with the opportunity to study at an American university, under the condition of returning to their home country immediately after finishing their degree.

293,Study Showcases Discrimination Against North African Students’ Applications in France,"“Even if this discrimination is less intense than what is observed in the labor market, it is very worrying,” said one of the researchers who carried out the study.",Safaa Kasraoui,"Feb. 15, 2022 11:58 a.m.","A new study by a group of researchers has established the “worrying” discrimination students from North Africa face while applying for Masters’ degree programs at French universities. 
The study was carried out by several researchers and targeted 19 universities and  607 Masters' programs, according to French website France Inter.
The study also sought to determine whether there is any discrimination targetting people with special needs, and it found that there is a “significant discriminatory treatment” on the criterion of origin but not on people with disabilities.”
“Even if this discrimination is less intense than what it is observed on the labor market, it is worrying,” the researchers concluded.
The researchers sent to the 19 universities thousands of emails with “fictitious applications” or requests for information about how to apply to the universities’ master’s programs. 
In their fake application emails, the researchers used both  French-sounding names and North African surnames to evaluate the level of discrimination based on how quickly or whether universities replied to the emails.
“Fictitious North African candidates have 12% less chance of obtaining an answer” regarding their applications or questions.
The researchers would send three identical emails to masters managing campuses, reported France Inter, adding: “Each time: three almost identical emails were sent: requests for information on these courses and their registration methods.”
The study also shows that the type of courses also played a role in whether universities would accept North African applications or whether they have fewer chances to be admitted.
“If we look at certain types of courses, in particular law Masters, among the most requested, the difference reaches 30%. For scientific Masters, North African candidates have a 20% less chance of receiving an answer. 
Yannick L’Horti, one of the researchers involved in the study, said that the more a Master’s degree is “attractive,” the greater the origin-based discrimination.

In the past few days, Videos have been going viral online of  both Moroccan students and other Arab students in Ukraine protesting for their right to remote learning. 
On the verge of a probable war between Ukraine and Russia, countries including Morocco have issued evacuation orders for their citizens in Ukraine.
Morocco’s embassy in Kyiv has asked Moroccan nationals to depart the European country as soon as possible amid reports that Russia is mobilizing more troops at its borders with Ukraine. 
Ukraine is home to over 10,000 students, and Moroccan students are the second largest foreign community studying in Ukrainian universities.
Following the embassy’s repatriation call, Moroccan students’ cry for help also suggests they are dissatisfied with the exorbitant cost of flight tickets.
According to reports, Ukraine's Ambassador to Morocco, Vasylieva Oksana, has said that the issue of Moroccan students will be resolved through diplomatic means between Rabat and Kyiv.
Oksana urged Moroccan students in Ukraine ""to remain calm and respect the directions of the relevant authorities and university administrations.""
She also noted that more than 20 Moroccan universities have collaborated with Ukrainian universities over the years, expressing her hope for the future of Moroccan-Ukrainian cooperation, particularly in the fields of culture and science.
Three repatriation flights from Ukraine are scheduled for February 15, including two flights from Moroccan flag carrier Royal Air Maroc.
The first flight will depart from Boryspil International Airport in Kyiv at 4 p.m. and arrive at Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca at 8:00 p.m.
The second special flight is scheduled at 6 p.m. from Boryspil International Airport, Kiev, while the arrival is scheduled for 10:15 p.m. at Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca.
In addition to the Royal Air Maroc repatriation flights, Air Arabia also announced on Monday that it will secure a Kyiv-Tangier flight today.

295,"Poorly Qualified Teachers, Bad Learning Conditions Hinder Progress of Moroccan Students","The survey revealed factors that “do not prepare 15-year-old pupils to continue their studies, nor for their future.”",Issam Toutate,"Feb. 12, 2022 11:47 a.m.","A recent evaluation of the Program International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 has revealed that teachers in Morocco are poorly qualified.
Morocco’s Higher Council of Education, Training, and Scientific Research released on February 9 the results of the PISA 2018 report.
The study found that only 10% of teachers have a master's degree, and only 65% have a teaching certification certificate issued by the authorities responsible for education and training, compared to 42% and 82% respectively in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.
Concerning Moroccan teachers' training, the survey found that only 22% of teachers have finished a one-year or longer training program.
Compared to 53% in the OECD, only 29% of Moroccan teachers participated in an official professional development program as part of in-service training in the three months prior to the survey.
Amina Benbiga, head of the Learning Assessment project at the National Evaluation Authority (INE), said that “Morocco is one of the countries and economies where teachers are the least qualified, if we refer to the level of education, the duration of initial training and professional development.”
Not only does the survey refer to human resources as an obstacle for students' learning and development, it also cites learning conditions.
“Many Moroccan children study in classes that exceed 30 students, and this observation is more critical in the public sector,” Benbiga added.
The survey also highlighted the lack of ICT resources in Moroccan schools, with only 24% of Moroccan students enrolled in schools with no computers, compared to an average of 1% in OECD countries.
Read also: Study Found Overwhelming Gap Between Public and Private Schools
It also revealed that 38% of computers available to Moroccan students are connected to the Internet, compared to an average of 96% in OECD countries.
Compared to OECD countries, where each teacher has access to a computer, nearly 21 teachers have to share a single computer connected to the internet in Morocco.
According to Benbiga, the lack or inadequacy of human, material or educational resources is more noticeable in public establishments with socio-economically disadvantaged pupils, compared to those in the private sector.
This survey’s results “show that Moroccan schools do not prepare 15-year-old pupils to continue their studies, nor for their future,” she explained.

Annual competitions within the limitations of the jobs should be held, with successful first-class graduates selected from trained secondary education teachers. The competition is scheduled for the end of 2022, according to the statement.
However, Morocco’s educational sector suffers many other problems. The government implemented new rules that sparked outrage among Moroccans, many of whom will now be considered unsuitable for teaching jobs.
The age restriction for applying for a job in public education has been lowered to 30 years old as part of the reform, down from 40-45 years in prior recruitment campaigns.
The government's new recruitment measures have sparked uproars in numerous places around the country, with observers and many candidates for teaching jobs condemning the new age limit as discriminatory.

In the presence of Morocco’s Minister of National Education Chakib Benmoussa, the President of Mohammed VI Foundation, Youssef Bakkali, and representatives of private schools concluded the agreements on February 4.
After reviewing major projects that have been launched to oversee and organize private education, Benmoussa said that the parents-private schools' relations ""must be built on principles of transparency, in accordance with the obligations of private educational institutions in the education system.”
The minister also stressed the importance of adequate working conditions, career development, and stability in ensuring good quality education within private establishments. 
For his part, Bakkali reported that ""more than a million [of Moroccan] students study in the private sector, i.e. nearly 18% of schooled children at the national level.""

The Mohammed VI Foundation-private sector partnership is part of the Ministry of Education's plan to create an inclusive, unified, and developed educational system that provides equal opportunities to professionals in the private and public sectors and ensures the delivery of good quality services across Morocco. 
On January 18, Minister Benmoussa signed an agreement with five trade unions to train human resources in the education sector. 
“The agreement is likely to contribute to the consecration and institutionalization of responsible and constructive sectoral dialogue between the signatory parties, to consolidate social peace within the education system and to consolidate the central role of trade unions in education as major partners in the process of education reform,” the ministry said.
Additionally, the ministry partnered with the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) to build 8,000 preschool units and 500 boarding schools in rural areas in 2019-2021 to generalize pre-school education and address school dropouts. 
Despite the governmental efforts to improve educational services, 56.9% of Moroccan households reported in 2021 a deterioration in education services, said Morocco’s High Commission for Planning (HCP).

302,Spanish PM Renews Support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan Amid Hostile Campaign,A number of marginal opposition political parties in Spain are taking issue with the Sanchez government’s endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 08, 2022 2:02 p.m.","Rabat - Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has once again renewed his country’s support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara.
Appearing at a Congress meeting today, Sanchez insisted that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the “most serious, credible, and realistic basis” to resolve the dispute over Western Sahara.
“We need a consensus exit,” the Spanish PM added, emphasizing that his country continues to support the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable and agreed upon solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara.
Sanchez’s remarks come in response to the hostile campaign a number of marginal opposition parties have launched to put pressure on the government following Spain’s official endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
In addition to the campaign from some MPs supporting Polisario’s claims, Algeria and the separatist group of the Polisario Front continue to release strongly-worded statements in an attempt to convince Spain to reverse its support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal.
In March, Algeria’s government recalled its ambassador to Madrid in protest of Spain’s support for the Moroccan initiative for Western Sahara.
In a telling statement following Spain’s decision in favor of the Moroccan plan, the Algerian government said that it was “surprised” and “astonished,” and it notably threatened to review its gas deal with Spain.

Spain, however, responded to such protests by emphasizing that although it shared good diplomatic relations with Algeria, the North African country had no rights to question, or interfere with Madrid’s “sovereign decision” to support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. 
In April, Spanish FM Jose Manuel Albares emphasized his government’s support of the Moroccan stance on the Sahara question, saying that Madrid had “nothing to add” to its embrace of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
Albares’ remarks angered Algerian officials who described his comments as “derogatory, offensive, and unacceptable.”
Such statements will “certainly not contribute to a rapid return to normal in bilateral relations,” said Amar Belani, whom Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune recently appointed as Algeria’s “special envoy in charge of Western Sahara.”
Spain, however, has repeatedly expressed its determination to preserve its strategic partnership with Morocco.
The latest statement of unwavering support came from Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska who on Tuesday called Morocco a “reliable and fraternal country,” adding: “Our relations with Morocco are extremely loyal.”

303,Moroccan Ambassador: Polisario’s Sultana Khaya is Not a Human Rights Defender,"While presenting herself as a pacifist champion of human rights, Sultana Khaya has been recorded and photographed while holding rifles and calling for war against Morocco.",Safaa Kasraoui,"June 08, 2022 11:10 a.m.","Rabat - The Permanent Representative of Morocco to the UN, Omar Hilale, has accused Algeria of hiring Polisario members such as Sultana Khaya to undermine Morocco’s territorial integrity.
Hilale addressed a series of letters to the Security Council to expose how Khaya’s maneuvers serve the agenda of the Polisario Front and their biggest supporter, Algeria.
“Sultana Khaya is in no way a defender of human rights, but indeed an agent working for Algeria and the Polisario,” said the Moroccan ambassador, recalling the self-proclaimed activist’s provocative acts and attacks against Morocco over the past months and years.
In his letter, Hilale emphasized that  Khaya has publicly called for an armed conflict in Morocco’s southern provinces, emphasizing that she has been making trips to Algeria where she received military training on the use of firearms and participated in military exercises.
The latest military camp training that Khaya took part in was from January 1-12 in 2019.  Footage and pictures later emerged of the hardline Polisario militant -- and self-described human rights activist -- holding a firearm and calling for war against Morocco. The footage went viral instantly,  prompting many questions about Khaya’s self-presentation as a pacifist human rights activist.
Polisario and Algeria finance Khaya with a monthly stipend of €4,300 to serve their agenda in her capacity as president of a non-registered association under the “Sahrawi league for the defense of human rights,” Hilale said in his letters to the UN Security Council.
“[Khaya] has a Moroccan passport and travels freely and regularly abroad, where she indulges [in criticizing the] human rights situation in Morocco without being bothered or arrested by the Moroccan authorities on her return,” the ambassador argued.

Khaya is one of the most controversial members of the Polisario Front. Just last year, as news circulated of her links to an armed branch of the separatist Polisario Front, the European Parliament excluded Khaya’s candidacy from the list of finalists for the 2021 Sakharov Prize, an award presented to individuals who have dedicated their lives to the defense of human rights.
Despite claiming to be a champion of human rights and a fierce chronicler of abuse in Morocco’s southern provinces, Khaya refused to meet a delegation from Morocco’s Human Rights Council (CNDH) in February. 
The delegation, which had traveled to the southern provinces to investigate allegations of human rights violations in the region, visited the Polisario militant at her home in Boujdour for an interview.
Morocco has long warned about Khaya’s hostile maneuvers in several letters to the UN Security Council.
In November 2021, Ambassador Hilale sent a letter to the UN body, detailing Khaya’s involvement with an armed branch of the separatist Polisario Front, and asking rhetorically: “With regard to the so-called Sultana Khaya, in particular, it is worth wondering since when have human rights activists been in military training, with the Kalashnikov slung over their shoulders?”

Togo’s decision to open a consulate in Dakhla reflects the West African country’s position in favor of Morocco’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara.
To date, over 24 countries have opened diplomatic representations in Dakhla or Laayoune to reflect their support for Morocco’s territorial integrity.
The latest country to open a consulate in Dakhla was Suriname.

305,UN To Cut Food Rations to Sahrawis in Tindouf by 50%,A UN World Food Program official says the decision is due to the notable increase in grain prices amid the Ukraine-Russia conflict.,Safaa Kasraoui,"June 06, 2022 2:24 p.m.","Rabat - The UN is planning to cut by 50% food rations directed to Sahrawis living in the Polisario-run camps in Tindouf, the westernmost province in Algeria.
Citing the UN World Food Program, the Spanish news outlet EFE reported that the decision to cut food rations directed to Sahrawis is due to “higher grain prices and freight rates.”
EFE’s report quoted a spokesperson for the UN World Food Program as saying that acute hunger is projected to increase by 47 million people if the conflict in Ukraine does not end.
“This represents an increase of 17 percent, being the most pronounced in sub-Saharan Africa,” the spokesperson said, adding that the cutting of food rations will also impact countries in the Sahel region.
The news is set to compound the Tindouf camps’ long-running malnutrition crisis,  with recent reports by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, having repeatedly outlined the prevalence of acute hunger in the Polisario-run camps.
In his October 2021 report, Guterres expressed concerns about hunger and malnutrition in Tindouf.
Over the years, UN-affiliated organizations have struggled to meet the needs of refugees and improve food security and nutrition in the Tindouf camps.

The UNHCR, UNICEF, and WFP received only 58% of their combined resource needs for their regular programs in 2020.
Several reports have linked malnutrition in the region to the embezzlement of humanitarian aid -- including food packages and funds -- meant for distressed refugees by the Polisario leadership.
In a revealing report in October 2021, the Tindouf-based Autonomy Support Forum (FORSATIN) considered Polisario’s mismanagement and misappropriation of humanitarian aid as the main factor behind the severe health crisis in the camps.
The “smuggling” of medical equipment and food supplies meant for refugees has long caused acute malnutrition and other health concerns in the Polisario-controlled, FORSATIN documented.
“As soon as they [aid packages] arrive and are pictured, these devices evaporate as if they never existed,” noted the report, adding that the shortage of medicines has been one of the camps’ festering issues despite yearly supplies from UN agencies and other relief NGOs.
Even pro-Polisario websites like Futuro Sahara have on occasion reported on the chronic embezzlement of humanitarian aid meant for Sahrawi refugees.
In 2018, Futuro Sahara revealed that food packs and other relief items sent to the Polisario-run camps mostly end up in Algerian grocery stores.
In an even more damning report in 2015, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) exposed a scandal about the selling and the embezzlement of international aid intended for Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps. 
Covering the 2003-2007 period, the report documented how, amid widespread cases of malnutrition, poor health, and a large shortage of foodstuffs in the Tindouf camps, senior Polisario officials chose instead to sell EU relief products in Mauritanian and Sub-Saharan markets.

306,Algerian Media Claims MINURSO Chairman Owns Property in Laayoune,"Algerian media have accused the MINURSO chief of doing something that is neither illegal or in fact real, according to the UN.",Aya Benazizi,"June 02, 2022 2:12 p.m.","Rabat - Russian diplomat Alexander Ivanko, the UN secretary-special general's envoy in the Sahara and the head of MINURSO, has been accused by the Algerian press of being compromised by Morocco.
The Algerian media accused Ivanko of being corrupted by Morocco by claiming that he had purchased a property in Laayoune, the headquarters of MINURSO. 
Ivanko has resided in Laayoune ever since his August 2021 appointment as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara and Head of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara. 
The UN has highlighted that it is not illegal for UN personnel to purchase real estate for their own housing during their mission, yet pointed out that Ivanko has not bought a property in Laayoune.
“The head of MINURSO is facing serious charges. The Russian Alexander Ivanko, special representative of the UNSG for the Sahara, and head of MINURSO would have acquired a property in Laayoune. Is this ethical or legal?” wrote Le Soir d’Algérie, an Algerian news outlet, in its latest article titled “Scent of scandal at MINURSO: its head is accused of being corrupted by Morocco.”
The newspaper claims that the UN spokesman was evasive when asked about the issue, while Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Stephane Dujarric was unequivocal during his regular news conference on Tuesday.
“The special representative of the UN mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has not bought a house in Laayoune, as wrongly reported by several media,” he said. He even added that there is absolutely nothing illegal about UN personnel acquiring real estate.
Despite the UN spokesman's assurances, the Algerian press continued their media frenzy, claiming that MINURSO's legitimacy is under threat.
It appears that Algeria is targeting MINURSO for a reason. Algeria appears to have lost faith in the UN mission ever since the Security Council started removing references to the need for the organization of a referendum in the Sahara, instead favoring an exclusively political solution.

307,Italian MPs Create Parliamentary Group to Support Moroccan Autonomy Plan,The group cited growing support for the proposal in Europe and internationally.,Oussama Aamari,"May 31, 2022 8:02 p.m.","Rabat - Several Italian parties formed a parliamentary group on Monday May 30 to support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara.
Citing the growing support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal in the Arab world, Africa, and other regions, Italian MPs Marco Di Maio and Urania Papatheu said in a statement that Morocco’s plan has “started a positive dynamic for the Sahara.”
“Our objective is to reinforce the United Nations’ efforts to reach a pragmatic, political, and realistic solution based on compromise,” they added. “Numerous European states consider the autonomy plan as the most serious and credible solution to put an end to this dispute.”
The Italian politicians also said the Western Sahara dispute is one of the most pressing issues preventing North African states from uniting and facing common challenges for the region and the African continent, such as terrorism and climate change.
Di Maio and Papatheu cited the recent visit of Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio in April, who said Morocco is a strategic partner and “key interlocutor on regional issues.”
Morocco proposed the Autonomy Plan to the UN in 2007, suggesting that the country’s Southern Provinces retain a degree of economic and political independence under Moroccan sovereignty. 
Over the past years, the Moroccan proposal has been widely lauded in the international community as the  most pragmatic and only viable way out of the lingering dispute over the Western Sahara region.  Most recently, the proposal has garnered critical support from the United States, Spain, and Germany.

In comments made during her meeting with Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita, Rouamba stressed that the kingdom's autonomy plan ""represents the only credible and realistic solution"" to the Western Sahara dispute.
As well as describing the Moroccan autonomy plan as ""a credible as serious solution for the Western Sahara dispute,"" the head of Burkinabe diplomacy hailed the UN's efforts for reaching a realistic, practical, and lasting solution to the long-standing territorial dispute.
Invoking recent recommendations by the UN Security Council and the decision of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the African Union held in July 2018, Rouamba argued that any solution to the Western Sahara question must preserve the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Morocco.
Meanwhile, Bourita welcomed Burkina Faso's participation in the ministerial conference in support of Morocco's autonomy initiative held virtually in January 2021 alongside the US.
The Moroccan minister recalled the opening of Burkina Faso's Consulate General in Dakhla in October 2020, notably expressing Rabat’s readiness to further strengthen cooperation with Ouagadougou.
Earlier this year, Morocco and Burkina Faso renewed their commitment to developing multi-dimensional cooperation at the bilateral, regional, and international levels. 
The two countries also agreed to extend their cooperation to fight against terrorism and radicalism and the implementation of economic, technical-scientific, and cultural projects for the benefit of their respective people.
The value of Moroccan exports to Burkina Faso reached $83.7 million in 2019. According to OEC data, the exports included refined petroleum ($27.3 million), insulated wire ($7.81 million), and mineral or chemical fertilizers ($5.89 million).

The presidential decree detailing the diplomatic transfers said that Belyaev was “dismissed” from his post, and that Shuvaev has been “freed” from his work in Rabat to replace him.
The decision comes as the country is still grappling with western sanctions and trying to garner some level of international support amid its war in Ukraine.
Observers have noted the decision comes a few days after Belyaev commented to Algerian press saying that Moscow and Algiers are in constant “consultation” over the Western Sahara dispute.
With Morocco having maintained a relatively neutral position on the Moscow-Kyiv conflict, the development would suggest that Russia would like to keep diplomatic relations with Morocco and other nations good to keep precious international support.
Russia also announced on Friday that it has appointed Vladimir Baibakov to replace Shuvaev as ambassador to Rabat.
Baibakov led a prolific diplomatic career for Moscow before this most recent assignment.
He notably worked as a senior counselor in Russia’s embassy to the United States, as well as the Director of the Department of the Middle East and North Africa in Russia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry. Baibakov also served as Chief Diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Mauritania.

Gonzalez had been facing a lawsuit after she decided to allow Polisario leader Ghali access to Spanish territory for hospitalization in April 2021. 
“There is no indication to support the conclusion that [the former FM] was aware of the existence of a legal interest in this person,” the court said.
Gonzalez welcomed the court’s decision in an interview with Cadena Ser, saying she “would welcome back” Ghali, if “necessary for humanitarian reasons.”
The court’s decision came despite reports and complaints, linking Ghali and the Polisario Front with several serious charges, including war crimes, rape, assaults, detention, among other forms of crimes.
The Canarian Association of Victims of Terrorism (ACAVITE), repeatedly condemned the separatist group’s  documented killings of hundreds of Spaniards during terror attacks against Spanish fishing vessels in the southern provinces of Morocco in the 1970s and 1980s
Sahrawi refugee and activist Khadijatou Mahmoud continues to seek justice against Ghali, who she accuses of rape and sexual assault
In a recent interview earlier this year,  the Sahrawi activist who lives in Spain condemned the lack of actions from Spain’s judiciary. The activist accused Ghali of raping her in 2010 at the “embassy” of the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in Algiers, where he served as an “ambassador.”
Several other people resubmitted their lawsuit to Spain’s judiciary to seek justice following Ghali’s admission into Spain.
Amid ongoing lawsuits and severe backlash from Morocco, Spain allowed Ghali to leave Spain in June 2021. 
Ghali’s entry to Spanish territory resulted in a deep diplomatic feud between Morocco and Spain.
The diplomatic crisis lasted until March 2022, when Spain and Morocco announced the restoration of diplomatic relations after Pedro Sanchez’s government endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara.

311,"Mauritanian Delegation Faces Backlash for Dakhla Visit, Support for Morocco",The President of Mauritania’s National Bar Association visited the Guerguerat Crossing with dozens of lawyers.,Oussama Aamari,"May 27, 2022 12:37 p.m.","Rabat - Around 44 Mauritanian lawyers  are concluding their visit to Dakhla for a training seminar, which ran from May 19 to 27.
The seminar is focused on preventing the exploitation of children in conflict zones, and is organized in Dakhla’s International Research Center for the Prevention of Child Soldiers.
The delegation, headed by Mauritania’s President of the National Bar Association Brahim Ould Ebety,  received criticism from some political factions in Mauritania. These groups, known for their support for Polisario separatists, criticized the group of lawyers for crossing the Guerguerat border while waving Moroccan flags.
Mauritania’s Union of the Forces of Progress accused the delegation of lawyers of “interfering in complicated regional affairs.” The group responded by saying that they are an independent delegation of lawyers who are visiting for the purposes of training and cooperation.
“Our actions and stances stem from a strictly professional place, and everyone should refrain from accusing the delegation of imagined political stances,” the delegation explained in a release to Mauritanian media.
Another union of lawyers allegedly belonging to the Polisario also sent a press release to Mauritanian media, saying the visit qualified as “a violation of international law,” due to the delegation’s entrance to the Sahara region while waving Moroccan flags.
Algerian media was similarly rattled by the visit, with some calling Nouakchott “the Makhzen’s fifth column” over the visit, claiming that it undermines Mauritania’s sovereignty. 
The delegation was welcomed by a Moroccan group at the Guerguerat border crossing before going on a tour that included Agadir, Guelmim, and Laayoune.
The Polisario and Algeria have been losing diplomatic ground in regard to the international consensus on the Sahara dispute, as over the last few years several international players have come out in support of Morocco’s territorial integrity and its Autonomy Plan.

313,Western Sahara: International Experts Call for Implementation of Autonomy Plan,The push to implement Morocco’s Autonomy Plan aims to end the stagnated dispute which continues to affect the rights of oppressed Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps.,Safaa Kasraoui,"May 26, 2022 12:25 p.m.","Rabat - A group of North African intellectuals from across the Maghreb gathered in the Moroccan city of Laayoune last week to discuss the viability of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the basis to end the dispute over Western Sahara. 
The experts aim to coordinate efforts to implement Morocco’s peace plan in advance of any potential deal between the involved parties in the lingering dispute that has destabilized the region and undermined regional unity. 
The event, which saw participation from experts from countries such as  Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria, called for the implementation of the autonomy plan for southern provinces under Morocco’s sovereignty. Resolving the Western Sahara dispute, the experts highlighted, would be a major step towards a more united Maghreb union.
In addition to journalists and civilians from the region, the symposium also marked the attendance of former Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmed Ouanaeis.
Ouanaeis is the president of the coordination group pushing for the autonomy plan’s implementation.
Libyan political consultant Mohamed Abdessalam Hadi El Mekouz, Algerian journalist Oualid Kebir as well as Algerian journalist and analyst Hichem Abboud attended the meeting.
Abboud, who lives in exile, was among the activists Algeria prosecuted in absentia for his criticism of Algeria’s oppression of activists and journalists during the Hirak movement. Abboud highlighted that the lingering Sahara dispute not only impacts the unfortunate souls trapped in the Tindouf camps, but also turns the 120 million people in the Maghreb region into “the big losers” of the artificial conflict. 
The gathered intellectuals are hoping to kickstart the process of implementing the Autonomy Plan based on recent Moroccan diplomatic victories, and call out Algeria as the responsible party for continuing the dispute, and the resulting Maghrebi fragmentation. 
“Our destiny as North Africans is in our hands. It is therefore essential to speak the truth, to identify the person responsible for this blockage and to keep our minds riveted on the future,” Moroccan historian Hassan Aourid concluded.
Morocco’s Autonomy Plan has garnered support from hundreds of politicians and countries, who see the initiative as the most serious and credible solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara.
The latest regional country to endorse the Moroccan initiative is Spain, which described the plan as serious and credible, emphasizing the need to put an end to the artificial dispute that has lasted for more than four decades.
Morocco submitted its plan to the UN in 2007, suggesting designating the Western Sahara region as a semi-autonomous region under Morocco’s sovereignty. The plan aspires to allow the region’s inhabitants full ownership to manage their social, economic, and political affairs, while the government handles both defense and diplomacy.
Like Spain, many countries have emphasized the importance of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan, including Germany, the Netherlands, France, and the US, among others.
Germany described the autonomy initiative as an essential contribution to resolving the dispute over Western Sahara, while the US recognized the Moroccan sovereignty over the region - commending the North African country’s efforts to contribute to the UN-led political process.
Many countries also opened diplomatic representations in Morocco’s southern provinces in Dakhla and Laayoune to reflect their support for Morocco’s territorial integrity.
Officials, journalists, and activists have also shared their optimism regarding the development programs in southern provinces.
One of them was Abboud, whose visit to Laayoune during the event regarding the creation of the coordination initiative in support of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
In a statement to Moroccan media MEDI1 TV, Abboud said he was amazed and shocked to see the development in the region.
“When I arrived in Laayoune, I blamed my media colleagues for not showcasing the development that the region witnessed. I honestly was amazed,” he said.
He said he never imagined that Laayoune was that “modern and big, adorned with flowers and green lands. You wouldn’t even imagine that you are in the Sahara.”

“Make no mistake about it: the Polisario is a terrorist group. They murdered 289 Spanish citizens,” said Gutierrez.
“Some may hide behind nice words, such as the rights of the Saharawi people, and good intentions,” the 58 year old politician added. “But defending an organization like the Polisario, which for me is equivalent to defending ETA, is something that this hemicycle should in no way tolerate.”
ETA refers to the Basque Homeland and Liberty, a separatist movement classified as a terrorist organization by Spain and various other EU countries and entities.
Gutierrez cited specifically the targeting of Spanish fishing ships by the Polisario between the coasts of Morocco and the Canary Islands in the 70s and 80s, which resulted in the deaths of 49 Spanish fishermen.
Opposition to Polisario within Spain has been more vocal since the country switched its position on the Western Sahara dispute, voicing its support for Morocco’s autonomy plan proposal.
According to reports, Polisario militia members have claimed the lives of more than 300 Spaniards as violence persisted throughout the 80s.
The Canarian Association of Victims of Terrorism (ACAVITE) recently condemned displays of sympathy towards the Polisario, similarly citing the group’s history with violence in Spain and against Spanish citizens.

Zapatero made his remark during an interview with Moroccan news agency MAP on Wednesday.
In the interview, the former Spanish official emphasized that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the “most solid, safest, and best path for everyone.”
Zapatero stressed that Morocco's Autonomy initiative for Western Sahara is in line with the UN-led political process, recalling the Security Council’s resolutions describing the proposal as a “serious and credible” way toward finding a mutual and agreed upon political solution to end the dispute over the region. .
Zapatero’s remarks followed Spain’s new position, supporting Morocco’s Autonomy initiative as the most serious and credible approach to find a lasting and realistic solution to end the dispute.
On March 18, Spain PM Pedro Sanchez addressed a letter to King Mohammed VI, in which the European country officially endorsed Morocco’s autonomy initiative.

Zapatero also commented on the end of the political crisis between Spain and Morocco, emphasizing that the new phase of relations between the two countries is a “positive message addressed to the world in this period of serious crisis.”

319,Tindouf Refugees in Spain Voice Support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan,"Support for the Moroccan proposal has been going up in recent years, with endorsement from the US and Spain being the most critical.",Oussama Aamari,"Apr. 05, 2022 8:52 p.m.","Rabat - Refugees from the Polisario Front-controlled Tindouf camp who have been living in Spain have come out in support of the Moroccan autonomy proposal for Western Sahara, calling it the most effective way to solve the territorial dispute.
Several of the refugees also cited increasing international support for the Moroccan proposal, particularly from the US and Spain, as well as other allies of the two countries.
“I support the autonomy plan,” El-Qadi Mahfoud Ennajem, one of the refugees, said. “It is the only solution that guarantees the Sahrawi people the best outcome, and I wholeheartedly support it.”
“There is no alternative. It is the best proposal in my personal opinion,” he added in a video statement that was broadcast on Morocco’s Laayoune TV channel.
Aselko Weld Bakar, another refugee, spoke approvingly of Spain’s endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. “I welcome the decision from the Spanish government. For me, it can turn a page on the suffering and separation of Sahrawi families,” Bakar said.
“This dispute has gone on for too long, 47 years, and we need a solution,” he added. “There is a solution, and it can end this issue that has gone on for 47 years.”
Spain voiced its support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan on March 18, and Madrid’s historic shift from “constructive neutrality” to a pro-Morocco stance has  significantly boosted Morocco’s position on the Sahara dispute.
In particular, Spain’s move is expected to cause similar positions in other European countries, adding to the diplomatic momentum that Morocco has been experiencing in garnering international support for its plan.
The Tindouf camps are known for poor human rights conditions under Polisario’s management, causing thousands of Sahrawis to flee the camps.

320,"Sahara: Spain’s Endorsement of Morocco Is a Moment of Truth for EU, France",Spain’s newly-announced position on the Sahara conflict has given renewed vigor to the increasingly prevailing notion that Morocco’s plan is the best route to a lasting solution.,Samir Bennis,"Apr. 05, 2022 10:54 a.m.","Washington DC - Whichever way you slice it, the Spanish decision to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara constitutes the most critical of all the recent diplomatic and political developments on the Sahara question. 
In addition to being of great, unprecedented historical importance -- this being the first time that a European country has supported the Moroccan settlement plan with such clarity and frankness -- the move will have significant geostrategic implications for the future of the conflict.   
That Spain was the occupying state of the Moroccan Sahara until 1975; that it signed an accord with Morocco in which it agreed to return the Sahara to its mother country; and that it never vetoed this agreement makes Madrid’s newfound position particularly important and an even greater boost to the Moroccan position.  
Meanwhile, it goes without saying that, for Algeria, the Spanish decision is a disastrous development for two umbilically linked reasons. First, Madrid’s support for Rabat is a painful reminder of the failure of Algerian diplomat’s tireless efforts to sabotage or at least contain the undeniably pro-Moroccan momentum Western Sahara-related diplomacy has witnessed in the past decade. 
Second, not only as Algeria lost in Spain an erstwhile accomplice with which it used to collude to undermine Moroccan interests, but the domino effect the Spanish decision is sure to set in motion constitutes a devastating blow to Algeria’s dreams of regional hegemony.
A sign of things to come
While the Algerian regime might have failed to foresee the calamitous ramifications of its ill-advised decision to terminate the contract of the Europe-Maghreb pipeline, Algerian diplomats should at least be discerning enough to know that Madrid’s siding with Rabat is the harbinger of more similar things to come. 
If nothing else, the Spanish decision will push many countries, especially in Europe and Latin America, to think of following in Spain’s footsteps. In particular, the move is sure to put unprecedented diplomatic pressure on France, the other country with historical responsibility in the genesis of the Sahara conflict.
Although France has been supporting the Moroccan proposal for fifteen years, Paris’s endorsement of the Moroccan position has never been as clear or explicit as the newly-announced Spanish stance. Rather, France has long contented itself with rehashing the pro-Morocco language the UN Security Council has been using since 2007. 
France has never said that the Moroccan plan is the most realistic, credible, and serious solution to the Sahara dispute. Instead, born of an apparent desire to sufficiently satisfy Morocco without completely alienating Algeria, the French position is that the Autonomy Plan constitutes “a realistic and credible” proposal. 
We know the well-documented significance of language -- in life as in politics. In political and diplomatic discourse especially, each word carries stupendous weight and the choice of definite or indefinite articles is pregnant with meaning, political significance. To say that the Moroccan Autonomy Plan is “a realistic and credible” proposal is not remotely the same as saying that it is “the most credible, most realistic and serious plan.” 
In the first instance, the speaker leaves the door open to another plan or proposal that may also be “realistic and credible.”  While in the second, which Spain’s Prime Minister used in his letter to King Mohammed VI on March 18, there is no room for any other interpretation. 
For the second speaker, thus, the hailed plan is the only game in town; it is either that plan or nothing. What does that leave us with regarding the issue at hand? This: Whereas Spain used to think like France in applauding Morocco’s plan while leaving the door of credibility and realism open to Algeria’s call for a self-determination referendum, Madrid now believes the Moroccan plan is the only viable route to a lasting solution to the Sahara conflict. 
This shift in the Spanish position -- which I consider a logical development of the Spanish position during the past two decades, given that Spain has moderately supported the Moroccan Autonomy Plan since 2008 -- is widely expected to put European Union countries in front of a dreadful, terrifying truth for many: Morocco’s proposal is the best and only way toward peace, prosperity, and stability in Western Sahara. 
The EU’s time for reckoning
As such, if the EU is serious about sincerely contributing to solving the Sahara conflict, and if it genuinely wishes to strengthen its relations with Morocco on the basis of mutual respect,  it should consider expressing its clear and unequivocal support for the Autonomy Plan. 
Such a strong declaration of support would be the first step in the right direction of furthering essential cooperation between Brussels and Rabat. More than that, however, it would also constitute a vital corroboration of the line of realism and compromise the UN Security resolutions has clearly embraced in all its Sahara conflict-related resolutions since 2007. 
Since 2018 especially, the UN consensus around the Sahara question has been to disqualify an unworkable and impractical self-determination referendum in favor of a realistic, practical, feasible, and compromise-based political solution.  
So, will EU countries follow in Spain's footsteps and recognize the importance of the Sahara for Morocco and Moroccans? And are they willing to stop hiding behind vague and ambiguous declarations to actually, vigorously acknowledge the unanimity that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan has secured in the past decade? 
Judging from the media statement the EU issued yesterday, in which it expressed its satisfaction with the normalization of relations between Morocco and Spain, I think the European bloc is not yet ready to discard its “positive neutrality” posture on the Sahara question to explicitly recognize the unparalleled centrality of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan. 
Still, if Algeria’s feverish, ballistic response to Spain’s change of position is any indication, the upcoming months and years will see the Moroccan plan gain much wider currency among diplomats in general and UN negotiators in particular. 
In this sense, Spain’s decision has made crystal clear what the US’ December 10 recognition had symbolically, though meaningfully, pointed to: That for anyone genuinely interested in preserving security, stability, and peace in an already fragile Sahel-Saharan region, Morocco’s plan is the only way forward.

321,Ambassador: US Did Not Push Spain to Change Position on Western Sahara,The American ambassador’s comments come in response to Russian claims the Spanish new position on the Sahara dispute could be due to US pressure.,Safaa Kasraoui,"Apr. 04, 2022 10:27 p.m.","Julissa Reynoso, the US ambassador to Spain, has denied claims that Biden’s administration may have put pressure on Spain to change its position on the Western Sahara dispute.
Recalling Spain’s official endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible solution to end the dispute, Reynoso said in an interview with Spanish news outlet La Vanguardia: “We didn't push Spain to change its position on Morocco. Spain made its own decision.” 
On March 18, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez addressed a letter to King Mohammed VI, in which he conveyed his country’s official support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
Ambassador Reynoso’s statement on Spain’s new position on the Sahara dispute appears to be a response to recent remarks from Igor Belayev, Russia’s ambassador to Algeria.
In a recent interview with Algerian channel Ennahar, the Russian ambassador claimed that Spain’s change of position was due to “pressure exerted by certain parties.”
While he appeared to insist that Moscow is committed to the UN-led political process to end the Sahara dispute, the Russian diplomat’s remarks were mostly in line with Algeria’s largely discredited claims.
In particular, Belayev claimed that the Sahara dispute is between Polisario and Morocco, and he appeared to be calling for the UN-led political process to again consider a self-determination referendum as a possible solution to the territorial dispute.
Pushing for a referendum and playing the “concerned neighbor” or “observer state” cards has long been a staple in Algeria’s Western Sahara toolkit of shirking its responsibility in sustaining the territorial dispute. 
For the past four decades, the country has been unrelenting in its determination to challenge Morocco’s territorial integrity, with the Algerian regime being known for sheltering, arming, financing the Polisario Front.
Despite Algeria's self-presentation as simply a concerned neighbor with no stakes in the dispute, UN resolutions have repeatedly called on Algiers to commit in good faith to the UN-led political process to contribute to finding a realistic and mutually acceptable solution to the Sahara dispute.
Most recently, Algeria belied its “concerned neighbor” rhetoric by angrily condemning Spain’s change in its position.
The Algerian government notably recalled its ambassador to Spain after Madrid announced support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, suggesting that Polisario’s separatism in southern Morocco is part and parcel of Algeria’s strategic goals in the region.

322,Western Sahara: UN Security Council To Receive Briefing on MINURSO,"Amid recent developments in the Sahara dispute, some have raised concerns about the prospect of a new momentum in the UN-led process.",Safaa Kasraoui,"Apr. 03, 2022 3:02 p.m.","Rabat - Members of the UN Security Council will convene this month to receive a briefing on the peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, MINURSO.
The Security Council’s monthly forecast for April notes that both the Special Representative for Western Sahara and head of MINURSO Alexander Ivanko, and the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura will brief the Security Council.
The council meeting will be the first time for de Mistura to address the council since his appointment last November as the UN Secretary General’s personal envoy for Western Sahara, according to the monthly forecast.
The personal envoy post had been vacant for two years and a half after German diplomat Horst Kohler resigned in May 2019, citing health concerns.
During his first regional tour in January this year, De Mistura conducted talks with all the four parties to the Sahara dispute, namely Algeria,  Mauritania, Morocco, and the Polisario Front.
The veteran Italian diplomat held talks with a Moroccan delegation, including Morocco’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita and Moroccan permanent representative in the UN, Omar Hilale.
During the meeting, the Moroccan delegation reiterated Morocco’s fundamentals in the Western Sahara dispute, recalling King Mohammed VI’s speeches on the 45th and 46th anniversaries of the Green March.
In his 45th speech,  the King of Morocco renewed Morocco’s commitment to work together with the UN “within the framework of the relevant Security Council resolutions so as to achieve a final solution based on the Autonomy Initiative.”
The Moroccan King notably said, “Morocco will not waiver in its position. Nor will it be affected, in any way, by the useless provocations and desperate scenes of the other parties, which attest to a headlong rush, now that their outdated claims have failed.” 
King Mohammed VI  emphasized the same points during his speech for the 46th anniversary of the Green March, recalling Morocco’s adherence to a compromise-based and realism-driven political settlement under the aegis of the UN.
Morocco has achieved several diplomatic gains in the past decade, with one of the country’s crowning achievements being the opening of consulates in Dakhla and Laayoune.
In addition to the consulates, Morocco’s Sahara position has been particularly boosted by:  the UN’s adoption of pragmatism and realism as the best way forward in Western Sahara, the US’ recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara, the African Union’s pro-Morocco consensus in the past five years, and the Spanish and German government’s recent endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most realistic route toward a lasting and politically feasible solution to the Sahara dispute. 
With Polisario and Algeria having rejected the latest UN resolution, many political observers have raised concerns about whether the new personal envoy, de Mistura will be able to inspire a new momentum in the UN-moderated dialogue. 
Kohler had succeeded in holding a few roundtables of talks in Geneva during his time as a personal envoy. But with the recent escalation in tensions, including between Morocco and Algeria, it remains to be seen whether talks between the parties at the UN initiative would be possible.

323,Russia Supports Algeria’s Sahara Position in Bid to Secure Ally,"Following Washington’s overtures to Rabat and Algiers, Russia has voiced its support for Algeria’s Western Sahara position in a clear bid to secure the loyalty of its long-term partner.",Jasper Hamann,"Apr. 02, 2022 5:34 p.m.","Rabat - Following a US tour in North Africa to secure Algerian gas for Europe, Russia’s Ambassador to Algeria has voiced his country’s support for Algeria’s Western Sahara position to curry favor with its partner in Algiers.  
Two days after US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visited Algiers in a bid to secure expanded Algerian gas shipments to Europe, Russia is responding in kind through statements in support of Algeria’s position on the Western Sahara dispute.
In a recent interview with Algerian channel An-Nahar, Russia’s Ambassador to Algiers described Spain’s recent foreign policy change in favor of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the result of “pressure to modify its position.”  The ambassador again reiterated Russia’s support for UN resolutions regarding the Western Sahara and the need for a negotiated solution.
Appeasing Algeria
The ambassador’s efforts to please Algerian audiences was made evident by his description of the dispute as being purely between Polisario separatists and Morocco. This perspective is shared only by Algeria as UN resolutions continue to highlight Algiers’ undeniable role in prolonging the dispute.
Ignoring Algeria as a party to the conflict is a common talking point among Algerian leadership, aiming to absolve Algiers of its responsibility for arming, sheltering, training and funding the separatist militia that has undermined peace and development in the region for over three decades.
Moscow’s representative in Algeria spoke of internal US opposition to the 2020 US decision to recognize Morocco’s sovereignty on the Western Sahara region, likely referring to the few US politicians that promote the arguments of Algerian lobbyists in Washington DC.
Provocation or desperate plea?
Spanish outlet La Razon painted the Russian statement as a direct message of support for Polisario separatists. Yet, the piece noticeably ignored any context related to the current US-Russia struggle to influence decision-making in Algiers.
Russia’s diplomatic support for its long-standing partner in North Africa is neither changed or provocative but appears to simply be a desperate counteroffensive to stop US efforts to push Algeria to expand gas exports to Europe, which would undermine Russian pressure on oil and gas markets.
Europe and the US have been eager to attempt to enlist both Algeria and Morocco in its efforts to isolate and punish Russia for its recent illegal incursion into Ukraine. Yet despite international pressure from key allies, Morocco has maintained its diplomatic stance that is mirrored by many in Africa, the Middle-East and Asia.
While Morocco regrets Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, it calls for immediate conflict resolution and mediation and respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity to prevent any unnecessary further escalation and loss of life in Eastern Europe.  
Conflict resolution
Spain, meanwhile, is firmly in Washington’s camp, choosing to arm Ukraine and expand sanctions in an effort to force an unlikely Russian surrender. Many experts worry that this approach risks prolonging an unwinnable war for Ukraine, while potentially exacerbating the bloodshed and undermining conflict resolution efforts.
Russia and Ukraine are currently negotiating in apparent good faith, with both parties willing to make some concessions to reach a mutually acceptable solution. As the two parties involved in the conflict work out their differences, Morocco continues to emphasize the need for such a negotiated solution while aiming to prevent further escalation, as it did successfully in Libya.
Given the current geopolitical context, Moroccan diplomats are likely to see Russia’s recent overtures to Algeria as a desperate plea to retain Algiers’ support, instead of a provocation towards Morocco, as Spanish outlet La Razon has framed it.
While Russia’s statement shows Moscow’s limited ability to entice Algeria, it is regrettable that peace and stability in the Western Sahara region continues to be used as a bargaining chip to curry favor within the current geopolitical crisis.

324,Algeria Hints At Gas Price Increases for Spain Amid Western Sahara Tensions,Spain recently endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy Plan for the Sahara region after traditionally maintaining a neutral position.,Oussama Aamari,"Apr. 02, 2022 5:09 p.m.","Rabat - Amid Algeria-Spanish tensions following Madrid’s endorsement of Morocco’s stance on the Sahara dispute, Algeria’s national oil and gas company Sonatrach stated on Friday that it is not ruling out a “recalculation” of prices for the gas sold to Spain.
“Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, oil and gas prices have exploded,” Sonatrach CEO Toufik Hakar told Algeria Press Service, the country’s press agency.
The CEO explained that Algiers has decided to maintain “relatively correct contractual prices” for its clients, but did not rule out the possibility of recalculating them for Spanish customers.
Spain recently changed its position on Western Sahara, supporting Morocco’s Autonomy Plan after maintaining “positive neutrality” on the territorial dispute.
The change in Spanish policy caused tensions between Madrid and Algiers, with Algeria recalling its ambassador to Spain and denouncing the newfound Spanish support for Morocco as a “betrayal of the Sahrawi people.”.
Madrid relies heavily on Algerian oil, and many observers have raised the possibility of Algeria rescinding its gas deal with Spain in retaliation for the country’s endorsement of Morocco’s autonomy initiative for the Sahara.
Other analysts have maintained, however, that Algeria cannot end its gas contract with the Spanish government since the current deal between the two countries is valid until 2030.
In recent weeks, the US has been reported to have reached out to Algeria to help alleviate the gas crisis the Ukraine-Russia crisis has caused in Europe.
When asked whether Algiers can fulfill oil demand in the rest of Europe amid the ongoing war in Ukraine, Hakkar said that Sonatrach’s current capacity cannot replace Russian gas.
Since Spain’s change of stance regarding the Sahara dispute, several other Spanish and European political figures have come out in support of Morocco’s plan.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is expected to visit Morocco soon, recently explained the reasons for Spain’s endorsement of Rabat’s position by describing Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most sensible road to a peaceful resolution.

325,Former Spanish PM Gonzalez Supports Western Sahara Autonomy Plan,At an award show in New York Gonzalez described the plan as the “best solution” to settle the Western Sahara dispute,Jasper Hamann,"Apr. 02, 2022 12:39 p.m.","Rabat - Former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has expressed his support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the key to resolving the Western Sahara dispute. 
During an award show in New York City, Gonzalez referred to Morocco’s peace plan as the “best solution” to resolve the lingering dispute and bring peace to the region.
Speaking at a Queen Sofia Spanish Institute gala, Spain’s longest-serving prime minister who led Spain’s return to democracy in the 1980s spoke at length about the merits of the Moroccan peace proposal that would grant extensive autonomy to the Western Sahara region.
""It is the most serious and realistic solution that has been presented for more than forty years,"" Gonzalez commented. 
Ahead of the award ceremony in New York, Gonzalez had previously described Morocco’s 2007 Autonomy Plan for the Sahara as “the only proposal with a viable outcome.”
Following a recent change in Spain’s stance on the Western Sahara dispute, Madrid now supports Morocco’s plan as the most credible path towards peace. 
Current Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez officially announced his country’s foreign policy change in a letter to Morocco’s King Mohammed VI.
On Thursday, Sanchez elaborated on his country’s choice to support the autonomy plan, explaining that “Spain has taken this decision with the full will to take a step forward towards resolving this dispute.”
Sanchez described the recent announcement as a logical step in Spain’s Western Sahara diplomacy. 
“The decision we have taken on the Sahara is a further step on the path that began 14 years ago when the Spanish government welcomed the autonomy presented by Morocco as a valuable contribution to the solution of a deadlock conflict ongoing for more than four decades,” the Spanish PM told the Spanish Congress of deputies.

326,King Mohammed VI Extends Invitation to Spanish PM to Visit Morocco,Morocco and Spain are opening a new phase of relations following Madrid’s changed position on Western Sahara.,Safaa Kasraoui,"Mar. 31, 2022 3:56 p.m.","Rabat - King Mohammed VI extended today an invitation to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to visit Morocco in the “very next days,” a communique from the royal cabinet has said.
King Mohammed VI extended the invitation to Sanchez during a phone conversation, in which the King of Morocco reiterated his appreciation for Spain’s efforts to improve diplomatic relations with Morocco.
Earlier this month, Sanchez addressed a letter to the King of Morocco, in which he announced the European country’s official endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara.
The Spanish government additionally stressed the importance of preserving diplomatic relations with Morocco, with bilateral relations strategically contributing to regional stability and peace.
The royal communique statement said that Spain’s letter is in line with King Mohammed VI’s speech on August 20, 2021.
Spain’s position also responds to King Mohammed VI’s call to “inaugurate an unprecedented stage in relations between the two countries,” the communique reads.
In his August 2021 speech, the King of Morocco emphasized that Moroccan diplomats have worked along with their Spanish counterparts in a “composed, clear and responsible way” to resolve the diplomatic crisis between Rabat and Madrid in 2021.
He emphasized his optimism in regard to future dialogue with the Spanish government, saying that the two nations would usher “in a new, unprecedented phase in relations  between the two countries on the basis of trust, transparency, mutual respect, and the fulfillment of obligations.”
Morocco and Spain witnessed an unprecedented crisis in diplomatic relations after the Spanish government sheltered Polisario leader Brahim Ghali without notifying Morocco.
Ghali traveled to Spain for hospitalization using a fake identity with the knowledge of Spain’s intelligence agencies. The move from Spain angered Morocco, which described the act as irresponsible and against the spirit of bilateral cooperation and partnership.
With the recent development, both Morocco and Spain are celebrating renewed positive bilateral ties, vowing to strengthen cooperation.
On his Twitter account, Sanchez celebrated his call with King Mohammed VI today, saying that the two countries have launched a roadmap to consolidate a new phase of relations between the two neighboring countries.
Sanchez vowed that the relationship between the two countries will be based on transparency and mutual respect.

Sanchez made his remarks at a plenary session of the Spanish Congress of deputies.
“Spain has taken this decision with the full will to take a step forward towards resolving this dispute,” Sanchez said.
The statement came in response to criticism the Spanish government received from pro-Polisario parties in the Spanish parliament.
“The decision we have taken on the Sahara is a further step on the path that began 14 years ago when the Spanish government welcomed the autonomy presented by Morocco as a valuable contribution to the solution of a deadlock conflict ongoing for more than four decades,” Sanchez argued.
The Spanish PM reiterated that his country considers Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the basis on which there are more possibilities to find a solution to the Sahara issue after decades-long conflict and status quo in the negotiation process.
Sanchez stressed that his government has the “firm will” to help overcome the Sahara conflict.
He emphasized that Spain has “reaffirmed” and “deepened” its position because there is now a new window of opportunity to resume negotiations after the appointment of the personal envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Staffan de Mistura.
The Spanish official said his country’s new position is in line with European partners and many other countries across the world.
Spain officially endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy initiative on March 18. Several countries and international bodies commended the Spanish move.
Sanchez recalled the EU Commission and High Representative of EU for foreign affairs support for Madrid’s decision in favor of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan.
A few days after Spain’s official endorsement of the Autonomy Plan, the French government released a statement to emphasize the importance of the Moroccan initiative, contributing to the UN-led political process seeking to find a lasting and agreed-upon political solution to the conflict.
Sanchez also cited Germany’s position supporting the autonomy plan, as well as the US which “continues to express its support “for the Moroccan approach.
“All UN Security Council resolutions adopted since 2077 have welcomed the autonomy plan and Morocco’s serious and credible efforts,” Sanchez concluded.

“Spain’s statement last week in support of Morocco’s autonomy plan for the Western Sahara, which others have already endorsed, is a positive development,” Lapid told the press on Monday.
On March 18, Spain officially endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the “most” credible and serious solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara.
Several countries and high-level officials applauded Spain’s new position, saying that it falls within the UN-led political process to find a mutually acceptable and agreed upon solution to the conflict over Western Sahara.
In addition, Lapid emphasized the importance of the two-day historic Negev summit, which opened on Sunday.
The summit is convening foreign ministers from the UAE, Morocco, Egypt, as well as US Secretary of State Department Antony Blinken.
The summit seeks to discuss regional issues, including Iranian threats.
“The Negev Summit sends a strong message to extremist forces, led by Iran, who are attempting to destabilize the region,” the Israeli foreign minister said.
He added that the summit is seeking to build a united front committed to defending and promoting peace and stability.
Lapid believes that a special relationship and strengthened cooperation will work to counter all threats, including “attacks against Bahrain and the UAE, terror attacks against Israel and attempts to weaken Moroccan sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are determined to bring prosperity and peace to this region and beyond,” he concluded.
Morocco has expressed satisfaction with its presence at the summit, renewing its commitment to continue to work with its partners to promote regional peace, coexistence, and stability.
Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita is representing Morocco at the summit.
During a speech at a joint press conference, Bourita cited Morocco’s efforts as a player in promoting peace and coexistence in the region that seek to create a “different narrative about relations between the people.”

329,Former UN Official: Spain To Influence European Stances on Western Sahara,Morocco continues to be a reliable European Union partner in several sectors.,Souad Anouar,"Mar. 26, 2022 1:15 p.m.","Rabat - Former UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Bernard Miyet has said that “Spain may be likely to influence other European countries” on their stances towards the Western Sahara conflict. 
Given the “geographic importance of Morocco,” Miyet said on March 25 in an interview with EU Today that the Autonomy Plan might enjoy more support from European countries following the Spanish lead.
Morocco’s sovereignty plan for Western Sahara was recognized by the US in December 2020 and endorsed by Spain as a “credible and serious”  autonomy plan on March 18. 
Morocco has long-standing relationships with EU member states in areas such as fishing, migration, drug trafficking, and counter-terrorism. 
“The Kingdom of Morocco constitutes a pole of stability in the western Mediterranean in the face of the security and migratory challenges that may arise. The Europeans wish to preserve this situation,” underlined the former UN official.

France, Morocco’s strategic ally and former colonizer, has “constantly preached  [within the EU] the need to take into account the risks and challenges coming from both its eastern and southern flanks in order to guarantee peace and security,” added Miyet. 
France has “traditionally” showed support for Morocco within the UN Security Council, the official argued, indicating that this can be “a major factor in molding a common European position”, particularly during the global energy crisis driven by the  Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
The closure of the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline (MEG) in October 2021 further hindered the natural gas supply to southern Europe. The pipeline delivers Algerian natural gas through Morocco.
Algeria refused to extend the  contract, accusing Morocco of “hostility.” The pipeline’s closure led to a 21.2% drop in Spanish natural gas supply in 2021. 
Earlier this month, Spanish media outlets reported that Spain is holding high-level meetings with Algerian officials to reopen the pipeline. 
As Spain recognized Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, the Algerian government expressed dissatisfaction with the “sudden reversal of the position of the former administering power of Western Sahara.” This shift might shape the course of negotiation on the reopening of MEG.

Estelle Ondo, former Minister of Forest Economy, Fisheries, and Environment and current Member of Parliament, said that Spain’s new stance is a “political and diplomatic” recognition that gives Morocco credibility and support, destabilizing enemies of the country's territorial integrity.
“This new position of Spain clearly means that Morocco is winning and progressing by garnering strong international support,” she said.
Ondo  also  said that “Morocco is in the process of making the world realize the reality of this conflict and the geostrategic and security implications of this file that some parties [Polisario and Algeria] on the other side seek to hide.”
This highlights the leadership of HM King Mohammed VI, who has made the Sahara problem the main focus of Moroccan foreign policy since His ascension to the throne.
She believes the Moroccan plan provides the tools to preserve the indigenous Sahrawi identity and safeguards its historical territorial and political sovereignty.
Mathias Otounga Ossibadjouo, Gabonese deputy, vice-president of the Law Commission, and former Minister of Defense, Budget, Youth and Sports, Tourism, and Decentralization, supported Spain’s position on the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. He also praised His Majesty King Mohammed VI's leadership for working so hard to bring this to a successful finish.
Regis Immongault, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current MP also said Spain's recognition of the importance of the Sahara issue for Morocco and the Moroccan autonomy initiative as the most serious, realistic, and credible basis is a “strong step forward” that should push multilateralism on this issue. He emphasized that Gabon “has always backed its brother nation, Morocco, in the settlement of this problem.”

Spain's previous position of “positive neutrality” on the Western Sahara conflict had long been interpreted as subtly pro-Morocco. But Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on March 18 a significant evolution of the Spanish position by describing Morocco's Autonomy Plan as the “most serious and credible basis” for resolving the Sahara dispute.
In an interview on March 25 with MAP, Morocco’s news agency, Jauregui stated that Sanchez’s position “corresponds to an idea that has always been on the table of our foreign policy, even if it has not been formally raised.”
Spain's position, he argued, will be “important” in supporting future international efforts to support the Moroccan autonomy proposal, which is a “reasonable” solution to the conflict. “It is not possible to form a new state in this part of Morocco, and it is not feasible to do so in such a sensitive geostrategic area,” he said, highlighting the need for discussion in reaching a solution to this issue based on autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty.
“We want our relations [between Spain and Morocco] to be the best possible. Many important things depend on it [such as] borders, security, economy, development... Converging with Morocco on multilateralism, democratic governance, economic growth, and development in the Mediterranean is fundamental for Spain and for Europe,” Jauregui said. 
He concluded, “Morocco is a democratic, advanced country that wishes to maximize its economic potential and aims to provide its people with prosperity and a future within a framework of democracy and full freedom,” he added.

""Spain's position, which has opted for the support of Morocco’s autonomy initiative, is still within the framework of the UN and the resolutions of the UN Security Council"", Borrell told Spanish television TVE on Friday
Borrell recalled that Spain’s position is similar to the stance adopted by Germany and France. Both countries have recently expressed support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as a serious and credible solution to end the dispute over Western Sahara. 
“All these positions respond to the UN Charter which pleads for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,” Borrell argued.
""The EU continues to advocate the same approach, namely a negotiated solution between the parties,"" he added.
Borrell's statement came in response to criticism from Algeria and the Polisario Front, who protested Spain’s new position in favor of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the most serious and credible solution to end the conflict.
On March 18, Spain officially endorsed Morocco’s Autonomy initiative, recalling the strong bilateral ties uniting Rabat and Madrid.
Spain’s position marked the end of an unprecedented diplomatic crisis with Morocco. In 2021, the Spanish government angered Morocco after it allowed Polisario leader Brahim Ghali to enter the Spanish territory for hospitalization.
Morocco celebrated Spain’s new position that ended a flaring tension between the two countries. Appreciating the new position, the Moroccan government said Spain’s move provides a clear and ambitious roadmap to boost and advance bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries.
Morocco strengthened its position in defending its territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara. Several countries joined a lengthy list of states, supporting Morocco’s position, including Germany, US, and France.
The US recognized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in December 2020, reiterating the viability of the Moroccan autonomy initiative as a credible and serious solution to end the dispute.

333,Western Sahara: Why Spain Chose to Support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan,"Morocco’s inflexibility in recent diplomatic tensions, the declining importance of Algerian gas, and Moroccan diplomacy’s growing advances all led to Spain’s historic U-turn.",Samir Bennis,"Mar. 24, 2022 2:52 p.m.","Washington DC  - Spain has assumed its historic role on the Sahara question by unequivocally embracing Morocco's Autonomy Plan as the only and best way out of the long-running conflict over the region. And in so doing, Madrid might have also paved the way for other European countries that have been concealing their reluctance to pick Morocco’s side behind vague, ambiguous statements of “positive neutrality.”
To Morocco, meanwhile, the Spanish government’s decision means the era of grandiloquent speeches unsupported by concrete actions is over. Having learned from the recent diplomatic crisis that has considerably damaged its once friendly and strategic relationship with Morocco, Spain appears determined to treat its southern neighbor with due respect, taking into account its interests and concerns.
Morocco: an assertive regional leader
Following the serious diplomatic rift that started between the two neighbors in April of last year, Rabat was adamant that the re-establishment of relations with Madrid could only be done on the basis of a more solid foundation of mutual respect, loyalty, and transparency. 
This Moroccan position was clearly stated in King Mohammed VI's speech commemorating the 46th anniversary of the Green March last November. Despite its willingness to turn the page with Madrid and other Western partners to embark on a new era of sincere and solid friendship, the King said, Morocco would not sign any strategic agreements with countries maintaining ambiguous or ambivalent positions on the Sahara issue. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez showed great courage and wisdom in sending the Moroccan King the letter that announced Spain’s historic adoption of a position that favors the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. 
Unambiguously siding with Morocco was no small feat for the Spanish leader, given that significant sectors of Spain’s public opinion are strongly sympathetic to the Polisario Front’s narrative. And the virulence with which many Spanish commentators have since attacked their country’s support for Morocco’s Sahara stance gives some indication of the audacity it took Sanchez to break with Madrid's historical ambivalence on the Sahara. 
To a certain extent, the wisdom and lucidity of Sanchez's decision should be seen as reflecting his country’s recognition, albeit belated, of the new geopolitical winds prevailing in the Mediterranean region. Morocco's regional influence has prodigiously grown in recent years, with the North African country becoming a regional -- African, to be more precise -- power that now insists on reciprocity and mutual respect in relations with its Western allies. 
This is particularly relevant to Moroccan-Spanish ties. And Sanchez’s letter to King Mohammed VI suggests that Madrid has finally resigned itself to the truth that maintaining good, solid relations with Morocco is key to preserving a large part of its economic and security interests. 
Spain's new, positive stance on Morocco's Autonomy Plan is therefore a clear recognition of Morocco's position as a harbor of stability and prosperity in the Maghreb. It also testifies to both Morocco's growing leadership in the emerging African geopolitical landscape, and -- most importantly -- the growing international consensus in favor of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan. 
To be sure, Spain’s new stance does not amount to an explicit recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara. But the novelty is that, for the first time, Madrid recognizes the importance of the Sahara for Morocco, as well as the need to ""guarantee the stability, sovereignty, territory and prosperity of our countries."" As such, without explicitly endorsing the Moroccanness of the Sahara,  Spain has subtly acknowledged Morocco’s sovereignty over the region. 
Volte-face or logical evolution?
While it surely is a historic turning point, the Spanish government's decision to support the Moroccan autonomy initiative does not exactly represent a radical departure from tradition. 
Contrary to trendy suggestions in the Spanish media, Madrid's stance is not a U-turn, but rather a logical evolution of its position in the direction Morocco required and expected from a strategic ally. With Spain bearing considerable historical responsibility in the conflict, the country’s new decision could also be interpreted as a sort of reckoning with history.
Hosting his Moroccan counterpart Abass El Fassi in December 2008, the former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero expressed moderate support for Morocco's Autonomy Plan, praising Rabat’s ""serious and credible"" efforts to resolve the Sahara crisis. The then Spanish PM even added that the Moroccan initiative ""constitutes a positive contribution"" to the solution of the territorial conflict. 
In this, Zapatero's speech simply echoed the language used in UN Security Council resolutions since 2007, when Morocco presented its Autonomy Plan. Yet, although this Spanish position was not a clear endorsement of the Moroccan plan, it was welcomed in Rabat amidst a regional and international context that was back then far from being supportive of the Moroccan thesis. 
Spain maintained a position of “positive neutrality” even during the two terms of former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy (2011-18). But things started going awry for Spain in 2018, with Pedro Sanchez coming to power in 2018 in a geopolitical context that was increasingly favorable to Morocco. 
Key in Spain’s decision to change some of its historical positions vis-a-vis Morocco was the sight of: Morocco reclaiming its leadership in Africa, becoming a key player in the Mediterranean region, and securing unprecedented international consensus around its Autonomy Plan. Madrid had to either embark on the new geopolitical boat of a boldly assertive Morocco or ignore reality and be swept away by overwhelmingly pro-Morocco diplomatic winds. 
However, at the moment of truth, when Morocco's position received a significant impetus with the American recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara, Spain failed to answer the call of history and chose instead to settle some scores with Morocco. 
The Spanish government broke its positive neutrality commitment with declarations that smacked of some sort of fundamental hostility to Morocco’s Western Sahara stance. A striking illustration of this was the then Spanish foreign minister’s tirade against the US recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over the Sahara. 
Faced with such dismissiveness from Spain, Morocco decided to postpone indefinitely the high-level Moroccan-Spanish meeting that was scheduled to be held in Rabat in December 2020. And things got out of hand between April and May 2021 after news emerged of Spain hosting the Polisario leader under a false identity. 
While many in Rabat had long expressed their dissatisfaction with Spain's duplicity on a number of highly sensitive and important issues for Morocco, Madrid’s decision to shelter Ghali and then shrug off Morocco’s complaints was a step too far.  
For Morocco, it was clear that Sanchez's government had broken a tacit agreement Rabat and Madrid signed in 2004.  Under that agreement, Morocco was to shelve its territorial claims over Ceuta and Melilla and instead strengthen cooperation with Spain in the fight against illegal immigration. In return, Madrid agreed to commit to a position of positive neutrality on the Sahara issue. 
Since then, although Spain’s official statements did not appear to support Morocco’s Sahara position, Spanish diplomats continued to endorse the Moroccan Autonomy Plan behind the scenes. 
In hindsight, it now seems this Ghali-linked 18 months-long diplomatic crisis was a necessary evil. Spain's newfound, unequivocal endorsement of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan is a step that Morocco had long been waiting -- and hoping -- for. 
In exchange for Spain’s new position, Morocco is likely to commit to alleviating the severe economic crisis that the two enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla have been witnessing since Rabat decided to close their borders more than two years ago. 
That does not mean, of course, that Morocco will agree to open up to the smuggling spout from the two enclaves. Rather, in their new agreement, Morocco and Spain will be considering alternative solutions that can serve their respective interests, without Morocco questioning Spain’s legitimacy claims over the two enclaves. 
For official on both sides, the important thing remains that restoring bilateral relations benefit the fight against illegal immigration and the delimitation of the maritime space of both countries off the Atlantic.
Spain’s concession 
Four main reasons stand behind Spain's positive shift on Morocco's Autonomy Plan. Throughout the recent diplomatic crisis, Morocco’s firm resolution succeeded in showing Spain that its territorial integrity is non-negotiable. 
Intractable and inflexible on the fundamentals of its Sahara position, Morocco signaled that it was ready to prolong the diplomatic crisis for as long as necessary until Spain was willing to treat Morocco as an equal partner. 
Enraged by Spain's ""betrayal"" and irreverent lack of reciprocity during the Brahim Ghali episode, Rabat made it clear that there could be no alliance or friendship with Spain so long as Spain continued to: violate the July 1990 cooperation and neighborliness treaty; shirk its historical responsibility in the Sahara conflict; and decline to recognize the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the only viable solution to the Sahara question.
With its back to the wall after months of crisis, Spain started winking at Morocco in an effort to get it to soften its stance. One telling moment of Spain’s growing readiness to defuse tensions was Pedro Sanchez’s reshuffling of his cabinet by notably removing the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Arancha Sanchez Laya. 
And with the appointment of Jose Manuel Albarez as the chief of Spanish diplomacy, Madrid’s discourse on Morocco shifted drastically. Visibly keen to organize a meeting with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita, Albarez spoke repeatedly in favorable, laudatory terms of Spain’s “essential” and “indispensable” cooperation with Morocco. 
But Rabat ignored Madrid’s charm offensive,  suggesting there would be no restoration of “strategic alliance” or “traditional partnership” as long as Spain was not prepared to end its “duplicity” and support Morocco's territorial integrity. 
The second factor in Spain's U-turn is the recent change in Germany's position on the Sahara. Germany's decision to support the Moroccan Autonomy Plan caught the Spanish government off guard, especially since Berlin had long been at the forefront of European countries that opposed any agreements between the EU and Morocco that included the Sahara. 
In their coverage of Germany’s decision, several Spanish media outlets said the move showed the Spanish government that if it wanted to re-establish relations with Morocco on a solid basis, it should simply follow the Germans' lead. 
The third factor -- and perhaps the most important -- is Algerian gas. Gas is the cornerstone of the relationship between Spain and Algeria. It was central to the agreements that the Spanish government and its Algerian counterpart brokered between 1972 and 1975 to prevent Morocco from recovering the Sahara. 
In the wake of the July 1972 tripartite summit in Agadir, through which the late King Hassan II sought to establish a common position with Algeria and Mauritania in order to force Spain to cede the Sahara back to Morocco, the then head of Spanish diplomacy, Lopez Bravo, rushed to visit Algiers and Nouakchott to thwart Morocco's strategy.
Bravo and his Algerian counterpart, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, notably signed a trade agreement worth $500 million during the Spanish minister’s visit to Algiers -- under which Spain committed to buying Algerian gas. Algeria has since employed gas to pressure Madrid into taking a position of equidistance between Rabat and Algiers. 
The Algerian game has grown in scale and effectiveness over the years, especially since Algeria has been the leading supplier of natural gas to the Spanish economy for five decades. Until last year, 45 % of Spain's gas needs came from Algeria, a large part of which was supplied through the Europe-Maghreb gas pipeline, whose contract Algeria recently decided to terminate.
That decision to not renew the agreement on the gas pipeline linking Algeria, Spain, and Portugal via Morocco has turned all strategic calculations upside down. Although intended to hurt or “punish” Morocco’s gas market, the Algerian decision has proved to be a geopolitical boon for Rabat. 
Notably, the decision has caused serious damage to the Spanish economy, sending shock waves through the Spanish political establishment. For many in Madrid, the main takeaway has been that Algeria is not a country on which Spain should rely to meet its energy needs. 
Spain has therefore turned to other markets to replace Algerian gas. In particular, the US market has become, for the first time since last February, the primary source of supply for the Spanish market. The US now accounts for 39% of Spain’s gas imports, far ahead of Algeria’s 23% since the closure of the Maghreb pipeline. 
With the Algerian gas set to decline in importance for the Spanish economy, Spain will eventually free itself from Algerian pressure and will be able to manage its relations with Morocco without the usual, Algeria-linked political calculation. That is the reason Madrid decided to endorse Morocco's Autonomy Plan. 
But many in the Spanish have appeared to fear that Algiers would retaliate against Madrid and cut off gas supplies. These reports missed one critical point, however: Gas contracts are long-term deals and no state can unilaterally break them. 
Whatever Algeria chooses to do next following its furious response to Spain’s endorsement of Morocco’s autonomy proposal, the country will have no choice but to honor its gas contract with Spain until 2030. Again, the inter-state regulations governing the gas business are not the same as those of the oil trade. 
Had an oil deal been the primary driver of Spain-Algeria relations, then yes, Algeria would have had the option of suspending its supplies to Spain, since oil contracts are generally short-term. This is an extremely important fact that must be taken into account when analyzing the reasons that led the Sanchez government to position itself in favor of Morocco, regardless of Algeria’s protestations. 
Indeed, Sanchez knows that Algeria, which also needs money, will not be able to terminate the gas contract binding it to Spain. And should Algeria decide to somehow terminate the contract, it would be in blatant violation of the international law that governs such deals. Most significantly, such a move would expose Algiers to the wrath of both Europe and the United States, especially in an international context marked by the war in Ukraine. 
Why would the USA care that much about a gas deal between Algiers and Madrid? An American company, Blackrock, shares 49% of the Medgaz pipeline with Naturgy, Spain’s national gas company; the remaining 51% of the Medgaz deal is held by Algeria’s Sonatrach. 
In addition to these three factors, the war in Ukraine and the geopolitical, political and security upheavals that it is likely to bring about in the short, medium and long terms have also played a role in Spain's shifting of its Western Sahara position in favor of Morocco's autonomy initiative. 
With Europe watching the situation in Ukraine with apprehension, many in Spain fear that a prolongation of the  Russia-Ukraine conflict will lead to unprecedented refugee flows and put the country in an overwhelming migration crisis. 
As it expects a substantial number of refugees fleeing Ukraine, Spain needs to secure its southern border by ensuring the cooperation of its southern neighbor, Morocco. Madrid’s goal and hope, then, is to get Rabat to help stem the flow of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, which has been devastated by the effects of the COVID crisis, notably food insecurity and political instability. 
What about France?
On a broader geostrategic front, Spain's clear support for Morocco's Autonomy Plan is sure to pile up pressure on France. It is true that since Morocco presented its Autonomy Plan to the Security Council in 2007, France has been at the forefront of the countries that have supported it. 
Yet this support has never gone beyond an almost mechanical repetition of the language used in the UN Security Council resolutions -- applauding Morocco's plan and describing it as a ""serious and credible"" basis for resolving the Sahara conflict. 
Even with the US recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over the Sahara having consecrated Morocco’s thesis and made a pro-Morocco shift less risky, France has continued to embrace the Moroccan plan as only ""a serious and credible basis"" to solve the Sahara conflict. But, as I said in a previous analysis, there is, especially in diplomatic language, an abysmal semantic and political difference between the use of a definite and indefinite article. 
In saying that the autonomy plan is “the most serious, credible and realistic” option, Spain is ruling out any other options. This contrasts starkly with France's language, which continues to leave the room open to other alternativer or interpretations. 
Like Spain -- and more than any other Western or European country -- France bears a major responsibility in the origins of the Sahara conflict. Spain would never have occupied the Sahara in the first place without both the Franco-British agreement of April 1904 and the secret agreement that Paris signed with Madrid in October of the same year. 
If Spain had not received military assistance from France and its campaign of ""pacification of Morocco"" (which was in fact a campaign of terror against Moroccan resistance forces) until 1934, it would never have been able to effectively occupy the territory in southern Morocco. 
Faced with the latest developments in the Sahara issue -- the UN and African consensus on the need for compromise and realism, the  US recognition of the Moroccanness of the Sahara, and now the German and Spanish declarations in favor of the Moroccan position -- it is now up to France to make the choice that is so obviously necessary. 
Such a decision will serve not only to repair one of the most cruel injustices that Western colonial conquest has inflicted on Morocco, but it will also and above demonstrate to Morocco and the Moroccan people the sincerity of the French position on the Sahara. 
Moroccan diplomacy, meanwhile, should make sure to implement the central thesis of King Mohammed VI's speech during the 46th anniversary of the Green March: That Morocco will sign no strategic partnership deals with countries that maintain ambiguous or ambivalent, or even subtly hostile positions on Morocco's Western Sahara stance.

334,"Moroccan Ambassador: Polisario, Algeria Responsible for Child Abuse in Tindouf",The international community’s inaction continues to provoke outrage among activists condemning child exploitation in the military by the Polisario Front in Tindouf,Safaa Kasraoui,"Mar. 24, 2022 11:19 a.m.","Rabat - Morocco has renewed its concerns regarding the situation of children in Polisario-run Tindouf camps in Algeria, where thousands of Saharawis experience inhumane living conditions.
Moroccan permanent ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale stressed Algeria and Polisario’s role in child abuse in Tindouf during his speech at the International Colloquim that the International Commission for International Humanitarian Law organized on Wednesday in Rabat.
During his speech, Hilale said that both Polisario and Algeria are guilty of “ war crimes,” deploring children's recruitment in the military.
“The armed separatist group Polisario and Algeria are jointly responsible” for child exploitation in the military in Tindouf, Hilale said.
The ambassador recalled that Algeria and the Polisario Front are defying all resolutions and international law, framing the protection of children in times of conflict.
“Those [children] in Tindouf, in Algeria, continue to be exploited with impunity as children soldiers by the Polisario,” Hilale added.
Hilale featured photos and videos showing military training to which children in Tindouf are subject to by the Polisario.
The Moroccan ambassador also listed similarities in the armed violence training techniques used by the Polisario and terror groups, such as ISIS.
Hilale recalled that Algeria is refusing a census of the population in Tindouf in violation of the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees and other UN Security Council resolutions.
Both Algeria and the Polisario Front refuse to allow a census in the Tindouf camps despite UN calls.
The UN Security Council Resolution 2602 urged Algeria and Polisario to allow a census amid dire conditions Sahrawis face in the Tindouf camps.
The UNHCR estimates the number of Sahrawis living in the camp at 90,0000. 
Amid continued refusal from Algeria and Polisario to allow a census, former leading members from the Polisario Front argue that the reason why the Algerian regime and the separatist group would not allow a census in the region is that only 20% of the camps’ population are of Sahrawi origin.
Former Polisario member Hamada El Bihi has said that 80% of the population in the camps consists of Tuareg people stemming from countries across the Sahara desert, including Niger, Chad, Mali, Algeria, and Libya.
Mustapha Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, another former Polisario leading member, echoed El Bihi’s testimony, agreeing that Sahrawis m account 20% of the population in the Tindouf camps.

335,Western Sahara: Algeria Handed Morocco Spain’s Support on a Silver Platter,"With its blind hatred of Morocco and absence of strategic vision, Algeria handed Spain to Morocco on a silver platter.",Samir Bennis,"Mar. 22, 2022 6:24 p.m.","Washington D.C - With the benefit of hindsight,  it’s now clear that Algeria’s halting of the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline contract, the natural gas pipeline that linked it to Spain and Portugal via  Morocco, was a strategic blunder.
 As it sought to gas-starve Morocco, the Algerian regime ended up fatally murdering all its ambitions to prevent Rabat from making a major breakthrough in its decades-long efforts to get Spain to support its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
 In this sense, Algeria’s cancellation of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline was an unprecedented and valuable gift to Morocco. For one thing, the move has reduced Spain's dependence on Algerian natural gas, given that the gas passing through Morocco accounted for 23 percent of the gas imported from Algeria by Madrid.
The decision has also shown Spanish officials that Algeria is no longer a trustworthy and reliable country in terms of meeting the Spanish market gas needs.
Algeria’s miscalculated gamble
 Algeria’s natural gas accounted for 60 percent of Spain's consumption at the turn of the century and ranged between 50 and 60 percent between 2014 and 2018. 
But due to the short-sightedness of Algeria's generals, Spain's imports of Algerian gas nosedived in recent months, falling from 45 percent in previous months to 23 percent last month. The US supplied 34.6 percent of Spain’s gas needs between January and February this year, supplanting Algeria as the European country’s first gas supplier. 
In September of last year, the US share in Spain’s gas imports was as low as 16 percent. With the surge of US LNG exports to Spain in recent months, it has compensated for the more than 23 percent of Spain’s gas imports through the now-closed Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline.  
 The agility with which Spain has adapted to the considerable decrease in Algerian gas exports to the Spanish market further implies that Madrid has been proactively dealing with this issue for several years now. Spain has pulled through thanks to its world-class liquefied natural gas infrastructure and its long-standing strategy to increase liquefied gas in its import share.
Over the years, Spain has built state-of-the-art infrastructure for the storage and conversion of liquefied gas. Spain is currently the most advanced European country in terms of infrastructure in natural gas storage, boasting six LNG terminals, while a country like Germany has none. Spain alone hosts the third of Europe’s LNG storage capacity.
Such a proactive approach and foresight was instrumental in helping Madrid overcome the devastating effects that the Algerian regime’s reckless decision to terminate the Europe-Maghreb pipeline would have had on the Spanish economy.
Algiers’s decision to stop the gas pipeline was intended to punish and harm Morocco's economy. But little did the Algerian regime suspect that this miscalculated gamble could harm its own strategic interests, especially its relationship with Spain. As of this year, LNG has supplanted natural gas in Spain’s gas market, representing 70 percent of its total imports. Just a year ago, LNG represented less than 50 percent of Spain’s gas imports.

Given its advanced infrastructure in terms of natural gas storage, Madrid will gradually be able to reduce Algeria's impact on its economy and weaken the gas card that the Algerian regime has been playing for five decades to pressure Spain and dissuade it from supporting the Moroccanness of Western Sahara.
Algeria was painfully reminded of this sober reality when, on Friday last week, Spain announced a historic shift regarding its position on Western Sahara.
In affirming, for the first time, its clear and straightforward support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan, Madrid put an end to the sitting-on-the-fence or equidistance policy with which it had approached the Sahara question for much of the past five decades to preserve its interests.
But more than the shattering of Madrid’s long-standing equidistance policy, Spain’s newfound support for Morocco’s Western Sahara stance means Algeria has lost the gas leverage it used to have on the Spanish political elite. The timing of Wendy Sherman, US Deputy Secretary of State to Spain, Morocco, and Algeria earlier this month, and just less than weeks before Spain announced its endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan suggest that there was coordination between Rabat, Madrid, and Washington. 
As some reports have indicated, this curious coincidence suggests that Spain may have received guarantees from the US administration that it will intensify its gas supplies to the Spanish economy and eventually help the European country wean itself off Algeria’s gas. 
Spain knows that apart from the gas deal its partnership with Algeria is almost non-existent. Furthermore, Spain is fully aware that the bilateral trade balance has always been in Algeria's favor.
By comparison, the European country has dense and multiple interests in and with Morocco, be it in terms of economic and commercial cooperation or the security and shared destiny by virtue of geographical proximity.
On the economic front, for instance, more than 1,000 Spanish companies are currently operating in Morocco. As well, Spain has become Morocco's first economic partner with a favorable trade surplus that impacts its economy positively. 
Algeria cannot retaliate
Contrary to what is being claimed in some Spanish media and political circles, Algeria will not be able to take any punitive decision against Spain.
And anyone who thinks Algeria can still halt gas flowing to Spain has, to put it rather politely, a wrong and misguided reading of the situation. Unlike oil-related contracts that are often short-term deals, gas contracts are long-term agreements that extend for multiple years if not decades.
Hence, Algeria is bound to honor the deal it signed with Spain in 2018 on the Medgaz pipeline connecting the Algerian city of Beni Saf to the Spanish city of Almeria. The agreement is valid until 2030, meaning Algeria will not -- or cannot, more precisely -- halt its gas exports to Spain.
Even more critical, Algeria will not be able to review the deal’s financial terms and mold them with the current rise in gas prices.
But should the Algerian regime somehow muster the temerity of terminating its gas deal with Spain in retaliation for the country’s pro-Moroccan stance on Western Sahara, it would be in blatant violation of the regulations that govern such contracts between states.
In such a highly unlikely scenario, Algiers would also be under pressure from the European Union and the United States, which has been working painstakingly for months to reduce the EU's dependence on Russian gas.
The Medgaz pipeline is 51 % owned by Algeria's Sonatrach, while the Spanish company Naturgy and the American company Blackrock share the remaining 49 %. Thus, if Algeria takes any retaliatory step against Spain, it would put itself in direct confrontation with the US.
In short, with its regime’s lack of strategic vision coupled with the blind hatred of Morocco, Algeria handed Spain to Morocco on a silver platter. In seeking to “punish” Rabat, Algiers ended up unwittingly fulfilling Morocco’s long-running goal of securing Madrid’s unequivocal embrace of the Moroccan position on Western Sahara.
More important than US’ recognition
Spain's declaration of support for Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is psychologically and symbolically more meaningful than the United States’ recognition of the Moroccanness of Western Sahara, which has become US official policy. 
With Spain having substantial political and cultural influence in Latin American countries, its newly-adopted position on the Sahara will undoubtedly affect that of many other countries in Latin America. So, the Spanish move might prove to be additional good news for Morocco given the country's recent investments in buttressing its diplomatic outreach in Latin America.
 But an even more pertinent reason is Spain’s historical association with, and responsibility in, the Western Sahara dispute. As the former colonial power of Morocco’s southern provinces, Spain’s epochal change of its long-held position of “positive neutrality” on the dispute is undoubtedly more shocking to, and unbearable for, the Algerian regime than the US’ endorsement of Morocco.
Since the end of 1960s, Madrid and Algeria have stood against Morocco’s territorial integrity and regularly colluded to thwart the country’s efforts to reunite with its southern provinces.
As such, Algeria’s furious response to Spain’s endorsement of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan speaks of the unparalleled pain and agony of losing leverage over, and the support of, a long-time accomplice.
For Morocco, meanwhile, Madrid’s historic change of heart is a potent vindication of the increasing preeminence of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the best way out of the decades-long diplomatic gridlock in Western Sahara. 
 And so, that Morocco was eventually able to dismantle the Algiers-Madrid pact, which had long worked in secret to oppose Morocco’s interests, is a testament to the growing effectiveness of Moroccan diplomacy.

336,French Politician: Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is the Only Relevant Solution for Western Sahara,"Dati, who is also a mayor in Paris, emphasized that any proposal other than Morocco’s Autonomy Plan would be “irresponsible and even dangerous.”",Safaa Kasraoui,"Mar. 22, 2022 2:30 p.m.","Rabat - Former French Justice Minister Rachida Dati welcomed Spain’s new position to support Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the “most” serious political solution to end the Western Sahara conflict.
The French-Moroccan politician on Monday  shared her comments about Spain’s decision, saying on Twitter that Morocco’s Autonomy Plan is “the only relevant, safe, and viable option” to ensure security both in Morocco and in Europe.
Dati, who is the current mayor of  7th arrondissement of Paris, emphasized that time has come to end the conflict over Western Sahara.
“Morocco must have our full confidence,”she said, calling on the EU to promote the resolution of the conflict.
Celebrating Spain’s position, Dati said that any proposal other than Morocco’s Autonomy Plan “would be irresponsible and even dangerous”.
Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez addressed a message to King Mohammed VI on March 18, officially endorsing Morocco’s autonomy initiative as a serious and credible solution to end the dispute.
“Spain considers the Moroccan autonomy initiative presented in 2007, as the most serious, realistic, and credible basis for resolving the dispute,” Sanchez said, applauding Moroccan efforts to work within the UN’s framework to find a peaceful solution to the decades-old conflict. 
Sanchez also emphasized his country’s ambition to further boost cooperation  and relations between the two countries, saying that ties between Rabat and Madrid are “inextricably linked by affections, history, geography, interests, and a shared friendship.”
Morocco applauded Spain’s  position, saying that the move provides a clear and ambitious roadmap to advance cooperation and diplomatic relations between the two countries.

337,EU Supports Development in Morocco-Spain Relations,"Good bilateral relations between Member States and Morocco can only be beneficial for the European-Moroccan partnership, the EU said.",Safaa Kasraoui,"Mar. 22, 2022 10:39 a.m.","Rabat - The European Union (EU) has expressed support for the latest development in Morocco-Spain relations, after the southern European country supported Rabat’s sovereignty over Western Sahara last week. 
EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali commended the positive,  and said that such acts contribute to  boosting partnership between the EU’s 27  member states and Morocco.
Spain ended its diplomatic crisis with Morocco on March 18  when it expressed support for Rabat’s territorial integrity and sovereignty over Western Sahara in a letter from Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez   to King Mohammed VI.
In the message, Sanchez conveyed Spain’s official recognition of Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as the “most” serious and credible solution to end the conflict over Western Sahara, marking  the end of almost a year of diplomatic crisis between  the two countries.
The crisis erupted in 2021  following Spain’s decision to shelter Polisario leader Brahim Ghali in hospital. The decision angered Morocco, which described Spain’s move as against the spirit of partnership and friendship between the two countries.
Morocco responded to the move, recalling its ambassador Karima Benyaich from Madrid in May 2021. It was not until March 20 this year, when Benyaich announced her return to her office, e a few days after Sanchez’ message to King Mohammed VI.
The Moroccan government celebrated Spain’s position, saying it provides a “clear and ambitious roadmap” to boost diplomatic relations between the two countries.
The EU also commented on the Western Sahara conflict, emphasizing that it supports the UN-led political process to end the dispute.
Marssali said that the solution to the Western Sahara conflict should be based on “compromise in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, in particular resolution of 2602 of October 29,2021.’
She added that it is “important to preserve the stability of the region.”
Following the adoption of Resolution 2602 in October 2021, Morocco’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita said the UN text consolidates Morocco’s position.
""Morocco appreciates this important resolution,"" Bourita said, stressing that the adoption of Resolution 2602 ""strengthens the success Morocco has made on this topic.""
