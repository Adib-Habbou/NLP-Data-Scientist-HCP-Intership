0,Only 15% of Morocco’s Rural Areas Have Access to Clean Cooking Solutions,Intoxication from carbon-intensive cooking solutions causes up to four million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.,Jihane Rahhou,"June 06, 2022 12:01 p.m.","Rabat - Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking remains relatively low in rural areas in Morocco, with only 15% of rural populations having access to clean cooking solutions as of 2020.
Despite increasing by four points between 2015 and 2020, going from 11% to 15%, access to clean cooking solutions in remote areas remains less than half that of urban areas, according to data from the World Bank.
Access to clean cooking solutions in urban areas stood at 69% in 2020, the report indicates.
Published on June 2, the document warns that unless access to clean cooking becomes a priority for governments around the world, over 2.1 billion people will continue to use traditional cooking solutions, including biomass, kerosene, or coal in 2030.
Traditional cooking solutions entail significant environmental, economic as well as health hazards, especially for women and children.
The COVID pandemic did little to help the trend as rising gas prices during the recovery period significantly slowed the process of phasing out charcoal.
Setting aside the environmental impact of traditional cooking solutions, the smoke from these carbon-intensive cooking solutions causes up to 4 million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, according to some estimates.
Commenting on the global progress towards facilitating access to clean cooking solutions, the World Bank’s report notes that it has been overall “slow” due to the pandemic.
The report further indicates that, on a global scale, the number of people who have gained access to clean cooking solutions rose significantly as more than 65 countries adopted clean cooking goals in their national strategies. 
However, population growth has largely dwarfed the progress, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
With the continent’s population increasing significantly, the number of people with constrained access to clean cooking solutions has, as a result, stagnated for decades.
